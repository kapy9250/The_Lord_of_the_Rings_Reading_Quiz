### Question 1 `[SCA/ACN]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Caras Galadhon as a city where more lights spring forth "until all the hill seemed afire with stars" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Reinforce the theme of Lothlórien as a celestial reflection on earth, where the "stars" of Elbereth find a physical sanctuary amid the "green cloud" of the forest.**

**Why this is correct:**
The imagery of "stars" and "light" is consistently associated with Elbereth and the Elves' connection to the Blessed Realm. By describing the city as being "afire with stars," the author emphasizes that Lorien is a place of un-dimmed light and mythic beauty, acting as a beacon against the encroaching darkness. It elevates the city from a mere fortification to a spiritual center.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text presents the lights as a source of "joy" and "wonder" rather than a tactical vulnerability. The city's primary defense is its "secret power," not its darkness.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Galadriel’s initial silence and her "long look" upon Frodo’s face, before any words are spoken, primarily suggest:**

**Correct Answer: B. An intense, spiritual "testing" and a profound intuitive assessment of Frodo’s character and the weight of the burden he carries.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that "she said no word but looked long upon his face." This non-verbal interaction is clarified later when the hobbits describe her "looking inside" them. Galadriel is using her vast "knowledge" and "thought" to gauge the strength of the Ring-bearer and his companions, establishing her as a figure of high authority and mystical insight.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Galadriel later tells Frodo "I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind," and she welcomes the Company as "friend[s]." Her look is not one of suspicion, but of deep, evaluative scrutiny.

---

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Galadriel’s defense of Gandalf against Celeborn’s criticism ("Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life") reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deeper understanding of the "higher" wisdom that governs the Istari’s actions, which recognizes that what appears as "folly" to others is often a necessary sacrifice.**

**Why this is correct:**
Celeborn views the entry into Moria as a tactical "folly." Galadriel, who "first summoned the White Council," understands that Gandalf operated on a different level of foresight. She recognizes that his deeds were "not needless," implying that even his "fall" had a purpose or was a result of a path forced by a higher necessity. This highlights Galadriel's intellectual and spiritual peerage with Gandalf.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text says "Those that followed him knew not his mind," including Galadriel. Her defense is based on her trust in Gandalf's *character* and his *wisdom* as an Istari, rather than on a secret shared plan.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s feeling of being "uncovered" and "as if I hadn't got nothing on" during Galadriel’s searching glance indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological "unmasking" power of Galadriel, who forces each individual to confront their most hidden desires and the potential for their own betrayal.**

**Why this correct:**
Sam explains that she was "looking inside me and asking me what I would do." This confirms that Galadriel's "glance" was an internal challenge. The feeling of nakedness represents the total lack of psychological defense before her insight. She exposes the hobbits to their own hearts, which is both a "test" and a form of spiritual preparation for the road ahead.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Sam's "blushing" and his subsequent explanation ("nothing worse than a wicked plot") prove that the embarrassment is moral and internal (the "garden of my own"), rather than physical.

---

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Boromir’s reaction to Galadriel’s testing—calling it a "test" where she "pretended to have the power to give"—suggests that his primary internal conflict is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A defensive rationalization of his own temptation, where he dismisses the Lady’s spiritual challenge by framing it as a manipulative or "pretend" offer.**

**Why this is correct:**
Boromir's pride makes him resistant to the idea that he could be "tempted." By claiming she only "pretended" to have the power to give what he desired, he protects his self-image as a "true" man of Gondor. His "doubt" of her "purposes" is a psychological defense mechanism against the reality of his own ambition and his potential to turn aside from the quest.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he may have felt a desire for comfort, his primary "testing" involved his duty to Gondor and his desire for a "weapon" to win the war, as implied by his earlier arguments at the Council.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s song for Gandalf ("A lord of wisdom throned he sat... in Khazad-dum his wisdom died") conveys:**

**Correct Answer: B. A synthesis of the mythic ("lord of wisdom") and the domestic ("battered hat"), capturing the dual nature of Gandalf’s presence and the profound personal loss felt by the hobbits.**

**Why this is correct:**
The song balances Gandalf's power ("trump-voice," "burning brand") with his accessibility ("old man in a battered hat"). This encapsulates why the loss is so "keen" for Frodo; he has lost both a cosmic guardian and a dear friend. The "death of wisdom" in Khazad-dûm reflects the Company's feeling of intellectual and spiritual abandonment.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The phrase "his wisdom died" is a poetic way of saying the *source* of their guidance is gone, rather than a literal critique of Gandalf's intellectual choices.

---

### Question 7 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The Mirror of Galadriel’s ability to show things "unbidden" and its danger as a "guide of deeds" primarily emphasizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The complexity of time and choice, suggesting that seeing the future can lead to despair or rash action if not tempered by the wisdom to realize that visions are "possible" rather than "inevitable."**

**Why this is correct:**
Galadriel warns that "some [visions] never come to be, unless those that behold the visions turn aside... to prevent them." This identifies the Mirror as a psychological snare. If Sam had rushed home to save his "garden," he might have *caused* the very failure he feared. The Mirror assesses the beholder's ability to remain "true" to their primary task despite disturbing visions.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Galadriel explicitly calls it the "magic of Galadriel," and she warns Frodo not to touch the water when the Eye appears, showing she maintains control over the Mirror's physical manifestation even if its visions are "free to work."

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s vision of the "single Eye" and his feeling that the Ring "grew heavy, heavier than a great stone" reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The immediate, spiritual "gravity" exerted by the Dark Lord's direct observation, which pulls the Ring-bearer toward the abyss of the Enemy's will.**

**Why this is correct:**
The physical weight of the Ring increases the moment the Eye appears. This is a manifestation of the "drawing" power Gandalf and Strider mentioned. The Eye’s search is not just visual but spiritual; it creates a literal "drag" on Frodo’s person, demonstrating the intense psychological pressure of being the target of Sauron’s direct, burning attention.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
His "shaking all over" and his being "rooted" show that the "slipping forward" is a result of the intense spiritual connection between the Eye and the Ring, rather than a simple loss of balance.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Galadriel’s outburst when Frodo offers her the Ring ("In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen! ... All shall love me and despair!") represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A momentary, visceral surrender to the Ring’s temptation, vocalizing the horrific "perfection" of a world governed by an absolute, even "beautiful," tyranny.**

**Why this is correct:**
Galadriel’s transformation—"beautiful beyond enduring, terrible and worshipful"—is the visual climax of her temptation. Her words reveal the specific "hook" the Ring has in the Wise: the desire to do "good" through absolute, unquestioned power. By saying "All shall love me and despair," she captures the paradoxical soul-crushing nature of a "benevolent" Dark Queen.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text says she "greatly desired to ask what you offer" and that she was "revenged for [her] testing of your heart." This was a genuine, high-stakes moral crisis for her, not a performance.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Galadriel’s final words—"I pass the test. I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel"—signify:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme act of moral willpower and self-sacrifice, choosing to accept the loss of her power and her land rather than achieve victory through the use of an evil instrument.**

**Why this is correct:**
Galadriel knows that if Frodo succeeds, Lorien will "fade" and she must "diminish." By refusing the Ring, she accepts her own "fading" and the end of her reign. She chooses to "remain Galadriel" (an individual with integrity) rather than become a "Queen" (a powerful but corrupted entity). This is her personal "long defeat," chosen over an easy but evil victory.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
She doesn't think Frodo is the only one who *can* use it; she thinks he is the only one who *should* carry it, because he is the only one who does not wish to "use" it at all.
