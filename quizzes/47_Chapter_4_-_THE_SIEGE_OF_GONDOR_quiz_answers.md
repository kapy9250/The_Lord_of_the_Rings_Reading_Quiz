### Question 1 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s description of himself as an "old patient spider" in his grey gloom suggests that his primary mode of leadership is based on:**

**Correct Answer: B. A stationary, web-like network of surveillance and long-distance "sight," where he remains at the center of a complex intellectual and spiritual information-gathering system.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor is "proud and subtle" and "sees far." Pippin feels that his every word and deed are "somehow known" to the Lord. This characterizes Denethor as a mental and strategic leader who relies on the "lore" and the "Stones" to monitor the world. Unlike Théoden, who leads from the front, Denethor's power is concentrated in his "high chamber," using his will to "wrestle" with information.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Denethor *is* suffering from grief and despair, the "spider" metaphor is used early in the chapter to describe his current, effective state of monitoring and intelligence-gathering, rather than a descent into animalistic madness (which comes later).

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s insistence that "rustic" songs about food and drink are fit for his halls during "evil times" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A poignant, perhaps even desperate, need for a reminder of the uncorrupted world that Gondor’s long "vigil" is intended to protect, characterizing the Shire as a symbolic justification for his own suffering.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor says, "We who have lived long under the Shadow may surely listen to echoes from a land untroubled by it." This reveals a rare, softer facet of his character. He views the Shire's simplicity not as "folly" but as a precious "echo" of what has been lost in Gondor. It suggests that his "thankless vigil" is motivated by a desire to preserve the very peace that Pippin represents.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Denethor's tone remains "grim" and "stern." His interest in the songs is philosophical and commemorative—a way to feel that his labor is "not fruitless"—rather than a simple, lighthearted enjoyment of hobbit culture.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s feeling that he is "taking part in no play" while wearing his new black and silver livery indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total collapse of his remaining "Shire-innocence," where the physical trappings of heroism are experienced not as a fantasy or a game, but as a heavy, burdensome reality of imminent death.**

**Why this is correct:**
In the Shire, armor and titles might be part of a "play" or an old story. Here, Pippin is "one small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault." The weight of the hauberk and helm is literal and metaphorical. He recognizes the "deadly earnest" nature of his service to a "grim master." This marks his final transition into the world of adult, epic responsibility.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While he *does* feel uncomfortable, the narrative emphasizes that the source of his discomfort is the *meaning* of the gear ("taking part in no play," "deadly earnest") rather than its physical quality or craftsmanship.

### Question 4 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s trembling hands when he learns of Frodo’s path to Cirith Ungol reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The staggering depth of the danger Frodo is in, where even the resurrected "White Rider" finds his composure shattered by the mention of a specific, ancient terror that he recognizes but cannot influence.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf is usually the source of unshakeable strength. His hands "trembling" and his voice falling are unprecedented signs of fear. This "heart-failure" at the name of Cirith Ungol alerts Pippin (and the reader) that Frodo has entered a region of peril so extreme that even the Wise find it difficult to contemplate. It underscores the isolation of the Ring-bearer.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While Gandalf is "disappointed" earlier, his reaction to the specific news of Cirith Ungol is one of "fear" and "trouble" for Frodo's life, rather than a simple loss of temper with Faramir.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s claim that he has "more lore and wisdom than you deem" and his rejection of the "fool's hope" of destroying the Ring illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A philosophy of defensive, static containment based on a profound lack of faith in the possibility of ultimate victory, where the preservation of the "instrument" takes priority over the moral necessity of its destruction.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor argues the Ring should have been "hidden, hidden dark and deep" and "not used." He views the Quest as "madness." This characterizes his wisdom as purely "rational" and military; he cannot accept a plan based on a "fool's hope" or the "weak." He prefers to fail while holding the "gift" of power rather than risk everything on a moral "hazard" he cannot control.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Denethor is a "foe of the One Enemy." His disagreement with Gandalf is about *means* and *possibility*, not about his fundamental allegiance. He hates Sauron, but he has lost faith in the West's ability to win.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s decision to send Faramir back to Osgiliath, saying "gentleness may be repaid with death," reveals his:**

**Correct Answer: B. A corrosive, "bitter" grief that has turned into a self-destructive cruelty, where he punishes his remaining son for not being the one who died, effectively sacrificing him to prove his own "fell" and un-gentle resolve.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor explicitly says he wishes Faramir and Boromir's places "had been exchanged." His decision to send Faramir into "needless peril" at the River is a manifestation of his internal rot. He is "stir[ring] the bitterness" in his own cup. He uses his son as a weapon to spite Gandalf and to "pay" for his own sense of failure, marking his descent into a tyrannical and "fey" state of mind.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Denethor's memory is sharp; he is using the *current* tactical situation at Osgiliath as a stage for his own familial and psychological drama, rather than acting out of a lack of information.

### Question 7 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Enemy's use of the fallen warriors' heads as missiles, branded with the "Lidless Eye," serves as a:**

**Correct Answer: B. Psychological weapon of total desecration, designed to shatter the defenders' morale by forcing them to confront the gruesome, "branded" remains of their own friends and history, asserting Sauron's absolute ownership even in death.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "horrible" hail of heads is more effective than fire. It turns the city into a "place of weeping." By branding the dead with the Eye, Sauron is making a symbolic claim: even those who fought against him now "belong" to him in their dishonor. It is a direct attack on the "memory" and "dignity" that Faramir identified as Gondor's core values.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While biological warfare is a possibility, the text focuses on the *emotional and psychological* impact ("cried aloud or wept," "face of someone that he had known"), characterizing the heads as a weapon of "dread and despair."

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s final surrender to despair—proclaiming "The West has failed" and preparing his "pyre"—represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate triumph of the "Shadow" within the Lord of the City, where his long-distance wrestling with the Enemy’s mind has resulted in a total internalizing of Sauron’s narrative of inevitable defeat and the "failing" of all worthy things.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor believes "the Enemy... sees our very thoughts." His vision of the future is one of "mean folk" and "hounded" remnants. This absolute certainty of failure is the "poison" of the Palantír. He has looked into the "Darkness" for so long that he has become its mouthpiece, fulfilling Sauron's goal by destroying the "White Tower" from the inside through his own loss of hope.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
He calls himself a "heathen king" as a description of his *fate* and his *mode of death* (burning), rather than a religious choice. He is rejecting the "long slow sleep" of Gondor's traditions because he believes Gondor is already over.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s refusal to be "released" from Denethor’s service while the Lord lives, despite Denethor’s madness, shows:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deepening of his "Shire-honour," where his commitment to a sworn oath remains absolute even when the authority he serves has collapsed, providing a moral anchor in a city of "withered" valor.**

**Why this is correct:**
Pippin stands up and looks Denethor in the eye. He refuses to "say farewell." This shows that Pippin's "servitude" has become a genuine, personal "fealty." He recognizes that Denethor is "not himself," yet he remains "true to his word." This provides a counterpoint to the "oath-breaking" of the past and the "despair" of the present, asserting the enduring power of a simple, honest promise.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Pippin's motivation is his "word" and his service ("I do not wish to be released"), and he explicitly states his desire to see Gandalf "in the thick of things" afterwards, rather than being driven by a fear of combat.

---

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The sound of the "cock crowing" followed immediately by the "horns of the North" at the end of the chapter symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. A moment of "Eucatastrophe"—the sudden, miraculous reversal of total despair (the Witch-king’s entry) by the return of the natural order (the dawn) and the fulfillment of ancient alliances (Rohan), marking the beginning of the turning tide.**

**Why this is correct:**
The cock-crow represents the natural world "recking nothing of wizardry or war." It signals the inevitable return of the sun. The horns of Rohan provide the "answer" to the "brazen-throated" trumpets of Mordor. This sequence is the ultimate narrative pivot: at the moment of absolute darkness (the breaking of the Gate), the light and the "help unlooked-for" arrive simultaneously.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The chapter ends with the *arrival* of the reinforcements; the battle is far from over, but the *nature* of the conflict has changed from a hopeless siege to an open confrontation.
