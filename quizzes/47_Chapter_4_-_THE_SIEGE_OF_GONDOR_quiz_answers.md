### Question 1 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s description of himself as a "spider" suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A stationary mode of leadership based on a complex web of surveillance and mental discipline, where he remains at the intellectual center of a crumbling defense.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor is "proud and subtle." Pippin feels his deeds are "somehow known" to the Lord. This characterizes Denethor as a mental leader who relies on the "Stones" to monitor the world. Unlike Front-line leaders, his power is concentrated in his "high chamber," using his will to "wrestle" with info.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "physical mutation."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "trapping Gandalf."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about "becoming un-human."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "making Pippin comfortable."

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s interest in "rustic" songs reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A poignant need for a reminder of the uncorrupted world his "vigil" is intended to protect, using the hobbit’s "simplicity" as a symbolic justification for his own suffering.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor says, "We who have lived long under the Shadow may surely listen to echoes from a land untroubled by it." He views the Shire's simplicity as a precious "echo" of what has been lost. It suggests his "thankless vigil" is motivated by a desire to preserve the peace Pippin represents.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Comedy" distractor about "retiring to a farm."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "mocking Pippin."
- **D** is a "Half-Truth" about "losing interest in military matters."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about the "importance of food."

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s feeling about his livery indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total collapse of his Shire-innocence, where the physical symbols of heroism are now experienced as a heavy reality of imminent death.**

**Why this is correct:**
Pippin recognizes the "deadly earnest" nature of his service. The weight of the hauberk is literal and metaphorical. He is "one small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault." This marks his final transition into epic responsibility.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Comedy" distractor about "dramatic scripts."
- **C** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "stage-fright."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about "disguises against Nazgûl."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "Men as actors."

### Question 4 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s trembling hands reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The staggering depth of the danger Frodo is in, where even the "White Rider" finds his composure shattered by the mention of a specific, ancient terror he cannot influence.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf is usually unshakeable strength. His hands "trembling" are unprecedented signs of fear. This "heart-failure" at the name of Cirith Ungol alerts Pippin that Frodo has entered a region of peril so extreme that even the Wise find it difficult to contemplate.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "exhaustion."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "Phial burning him."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "anger at Faramir."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "catching a cold."

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s claim about "hiding" the Ring illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A philosophy of defensive, static containment based on a profound lack of faith in victory, where the preservation of the "instrument" takes priority over the moral necessity of its destruction.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor views the Quest as "madness." He prefers a strategy of "containment" where the Ring is "hidden dark and deep." This characterizes his wisdom as purely military; he cannot accept a plan based on a "fool's hope." He prefers to fail while holding power rather than risk everything on a moral hazard.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "superior spiritual understanding."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about him being a "secret master of the Ring."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "brainwashing by Saruman."
- **E** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "hiding vs destroying."

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s decision to send Faramir back reveals his:**

**Correct Answer: B. A corrosive, bitter grief that has turned into self-destructive cruelty, where he punishes his remaining son for not being the one who died.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor explicitly says he wishes Faramir and Boromir's places "had been exchanged." His decision to send Faramir into "peril" is a manifestation of his internal rot. He uses his son as a weapon to spite Gandalf and to "pay" for his own sense of failure.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "tactical belief."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "toughening him up."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "magical sacrifice."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "polite manners."

### Question 7 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Enemy's use of fallen warriors' heads serves as a:**

**Correct Answer: B. Psychological weapon of total desecration, designed to shatter morale by forcing the defenders to confront the "branded" remains of their own friends.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "horrible" hail of heads turns the city into a "place of weeping." By branding them with the Eye, Sauron makes a symbolic claim: even the dead now "belong" to him. It is a direct attack on the "memory" and "dignity" of Gondor.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "tactical error."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "recycling."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "epidemics."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "unthinking military service."

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s final surrender represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate triumph of the Shadow within the Steward, where his wrestling with Sauron’s mind has resulted in a total internalizing of the Enemy’s narrative of defeat.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor believes "the Enemy... sees our very thoughts." His vision of the future is one of "failing." This certainty of failure is the "poison" of the Palantír. He has looked into the "Darkness" for so long that he has become its mouthpiece.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "fire-defense."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "secret passages to the West."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "power over the Witch-king."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "hotter fires."

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s refusal to be "released" shows:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deepening of his "Shire-honour," where his commitment to a sworn oath remains absolute even when the authority he serves has collapsed.**

**Why this is correct:**
Pippin refuses to "say farewell." He recognizes that Denethor is "not himself," yet he remains "true to his word." This provides a moral anchor in a city of "withered" valor, asserting the power of a simple, honest promise.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "inability to perceive madness."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "raiding the wine-cellar."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "becoming like a Man of Gondor."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "unpleasant work."

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The sound of the "cock crowing" followed by the "horns" symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. A moment of "Eucatastrophe"—the sudden reversal of total despair by the return of the natural order and the fulfillment of ancient alliances.**

**Why this is correct:**
The cock-crow represents the natural world "recking nothing of wizardry." It signals the return of the sun. The horns of Rohan provide the "answer" to the trumpets of Mordor. This is the ultimate narrative pivot.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "natural coincidences."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "captured livestock."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "bird-calls."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "mocking trumpets."
