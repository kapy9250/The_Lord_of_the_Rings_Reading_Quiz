### Question 1 `[SCA/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**What does the transformation of Bilbo into a "favourite character of legend" among the hobbits primarily suggest about the Shire's relationship with its own history?**

**Correct Answer: B. The Shire community tends to domesticate and simplify disruptive events into safe, fictionalized narratives.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that "Mad Baggins" became a "favourite character of legend" long after the "true events were forgotten." This suggests that the Shire-folk prefer a colorful, mythic version of reality that doesn't challenge their comfortable, parochial existence, effectively neutralizing the unsettling truth of Bilbo's departure by turning it into a "fireside-story."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While the Shire values conformity, the text describes the "Mad Baggins" legend as a "favourite character," implying it's a source of entertainment rather than a tool for social control or a warning.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s internal conflict—the "other half of his mind" always replying "Not yet" to his desire for adventure—most likely reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deep-seated attachment to the comfort and security of his established identity in the Shire.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is described as being "quite happy" as "the Mr. Baggins of Bag End." The "Not yet" represents the inertia of a comfortable life. While he has inherited Bilbo's restlessness, his identity is still firmly rooted in the Shire's social and physical comforts, creating a psychological barrier to action.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text focuses on his "regret" and "wandering," suggesting the hesitation is an internal, emotional state of being "unready" rather than a specific calculation of external dangers.

---

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**In the debate at *The Green Dragon*, Ted Sandyman’s dismissal of the "walking tree" primarily serves to characterize him as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A representative of the Shire's willful ignorance and refusal to acknowledge the encroaching outside world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Ted Sandyman shuts down any "queer" news as "fireside-tales" and "moonshine." His insistence that what was seen "was an elm tree" despite evidence to the contrary reflects a defensive parochialism. He represents the segment of hobbit society that chooses to mock or ignore anything that might disturb their sense of safety.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Ted's skepticism is not "scientific"; it is dismissive and mocking. He isn't looking for proof; he is looking to close the conversation and maintain the status quo.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**When Gandalf reappears after nine years, Frodo notes that the wizard looks "older and more careworn." This observation, combined with Gandalf’s subsequent silence, implies:**

**Correct Answer: B. Gandalf has been burdened by the weight of the discoveries he has made during his long absence.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf's physical change and his initial refusal to discuss his business suggest he has been engaged in a difficult, perhaps distressing, search for truth (his "dark journeys"). His appearance reflects the gravity of the "tidings" he eventually delivers, which cast a "dark shadow" over the morning.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While he is careworn, there is no evidence he has "lost faith." In fact, his return to the Shire and his testing of the Ring show he is actively working to address the danger.

---

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s description of the "lesser rings" as "trifles" to the Elven-smiths, yet "dangerous for mortals," highlights a theme of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The vast disparity in perspective and power between the immortal Elves and the short-lived mortals.**

**Why this is correct:**
What Elves consider a mere "essay" or "trifle" can still "utterly overcome anyone of mortal race." This emphasizes that Elven power exists on a scale that mortals (and even Gandalf, who warns about it) find overwhelming. It underscores the vulnerability of hobbits and humans in the face of ancient, high-magic crafts.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gandalf doesn't accuse the Elves of "negligence." He is explaining the nature of the objects themselves and the inherent danger they pose to those with shorter lifespans and different psychological makeups.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ACN]` `[Advanced]`

**What is the primary significance of Bilbo’s "lies" regarding how he won the Ring, as analyzed by Gandalf?**

**Correct Answer: B. They indicate that the Ring immediately begins to manipulate the owner's sense of morality to ensure its own security.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf notes that the "lies were too much alike for my comfort," comparing Bilbo's story to Gollum's "birthday-present" lie. This pattern shows that the Ring exerts an "unwholesome power" that forces its keeper to invent a legitimate "claim" to it, signaling the Ring's early psychological grip on the owner.

**Why C is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he may have been defensive, the key point Gandalf makes is that the *nature* of the lie (inventing a "present" or a "win") is a specific symptom of the Ring's influence, seen in both Bilbo and Gollum.

### Question 7 `[ANT/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s reaction to the fiery letters on the Ring—his "quavering voice" and his description of them as "remote, as if out of a great depth"—suggests an emotional response of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A realization of the Ring’s vast, ancient, and utterly alien nature.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "quavering voice" indicates fear, but the description of the letters as "remote" and "out of a great depth" suggests a spiritual or existential awe. Frodo is perceiving for the first time that the Ring is not just a "beautiful" trinket but a historical artifact of immense, dark power that connects him to a "Black Years" he barely understands.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
He has already seen the fire-writing; the "disbelief" phase has passed, replaced by the "terrifying" reality Gandalf is explaining.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s explanation of "Pity" in relation to Bilbo’s choice not to kill Gollum serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Argue that moral intent at the moment of acquisition can provide a temporary shield against the Ring's corruption.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf explicitly states that Bilbo "took so little hurt from the evil... because he began his ownership of the Ring... With Pity." This introduces the idea that the character of the bearer and their initial moral choices determine how quickly and deeply the Ring can corrupt them.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gandalf frames it as a positive "Mercy" and "Pity," a strength of character, rather than a lack of courage. He calls it a "reward."

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**When Gandalf refuses to take the Ring, crying "Do not tempt me!", his reaction primarily reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound self-awareness of how even his noble desires could be corrupted into tyranny by the Ring's power.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf admits that the "way of the Ring to my heart is by pity... and the desire of strength to do good." He recognizes that the Ring would use his altruism to turn him into something "terrible," like the Dark Lord himself. His outburst is a defensive reaction against his own internal potential for corruption.

**Why E is incorrect** `[CC]`:
The issue isn't whether the Ring is "more powerful" than Gandalf in a combat sense, but that its *influence* would exploit Gandalf's specific personality and power to create a new, perhaps worse, Dark Lord.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to leave the Shire, motivated by a desire to "save the Shire" but also a "great desire to follow Bilbo," indicates that his choice is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A complex mixture of perceived moral duty and a long-suppressed personal longing for escape and connection.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text shows Frodo weighing the "exile" and "flight from danger" against the "firm foothold" of the Shire. However, it also mentions that a "great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart." His decision is not purely a selfless sacrifice; it is also a fulfillment of the "restless" side of his nature that has been "approaching fifty" and dreaming of mountains.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he does want to "save the Shire," the text explicitly highlights his personal desire to follow Bilbo as a "strong" motivator that "overcame his fear."
