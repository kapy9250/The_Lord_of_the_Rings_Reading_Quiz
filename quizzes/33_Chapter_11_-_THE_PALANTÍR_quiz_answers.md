### Question 1 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s remark that Saruman’s sneer is a "compliment" to Merry and Pippin primarily suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. That Saruman’s "great mind" is fundamentally unsettled by the unpredictable and "unimportant" nature of the hobbits, whose very existence challenges his logic of power.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf explains that Saruman is troubled by the "little riddles" of who the hobbits are and how they escaped. Saruman's worldview, focused on "High" politics and "Great" powers, cannot account for the "rag-tag" hobbits. His "sneer" is a defensive reaction to something he cannot understand or control, making it a backhanded "compliment" to the hobbits' unique role in the world's fate.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While it *does* make Merry feel better, Gandalf's primary point is about Saruman's *intellectual* failure and his fixation on the "unforeseen" element the hobbits represent.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s "quaking knees" and his inability to return the stone to Gandalf’s hand reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The paralyzing conflict between his conscious moral guilt and the addictive, near-hypnotic "draw" of the Palantír, which has already compromised his willpower and forced him into a state of compulsive curiosity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Pippin calls himself an "idiotic fool," showing he knows what he is doing is wrong. Yet, his "knees quaked" and he "did not dare" to put it back. This physical reaction illustrates the power of the Stone's "draw." He is trapped between his fear of Gandalf and his consuming desire to see into the Stone, a conflict that renders him incapable of returning to safety.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text mentions it "felt so very heavy" in the previous chapter, but here it says it was "not quite so heavy as he had expected." His physical trembling is a result of his *internal, psychological* state (fear and compulsion) rather than the literal weight of the object.

### Question 3 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Pippin gazing at the Palantír as "a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Diminish the mythic scale of the artifact by comparing Pippin’s interaction with it to a base, domestic appetite, emphasizing the "un-Great" but potentially catastrophic nature of his interference.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Palantír is a "Rhyme of Lore" artifact from the Elder Days. Comparing Pippin to a "greedy child" highlights the absurdity of the situation: a cosmic tool of high wizardry is being "stolen" by a hobbit for a moment of idle curiosity. It underscores the theme that the "Great" affairs of the world are often disrupted by the most mundane and "unimportant" human (or hobbit) impulses.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The metaphor is about his *posture* and the *nature of his desire* (an unthinking, physical "hunger" for the vision), rather than a literal biological hunger for food.

### Question 4 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s immediate forgiveness of Pippin ("A fool, but an honest fool, you remain") indicates that his criteria for judgment are based on:**

**Correct Answer: B. The fundamental integrity and transparency of the individual's soul, recognizing that a lack of "lie" and an absence of malice are more significant than a momentary lapse in judgment or "folly."**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf holds Pippin's gaze and says "There is no lie in your eyes." He recognizes that Pippin acted out of curiosity, not treachery. This differentiates him from Saruman. Gandalf values the "honest" heart, even when it is "foolish," because honesty is the foundation of the fellowship. He focuses on the *person* rather than just the *result* of the action.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gandalf says "Wiser ones might have done worse," implying that the risk of the Stone is universal and not specific to hobbits. His judgment is based on Pippin's individual "honesty" in that moment.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s claim to the Orthanc-stone ("There is one who may claim it by right. ... I will take it") marks a further step in his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Assumption of the full rights and responsibilities of his lineage, asserting his peerage with the "Kings of Old" and his readiness to engage with the Enemy on a sovereign level.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn identifies the Stone as part of the "treasury of Elendil." By saying "Now my hour draws near. I will take it," he is moving from the role of "guide" into the role of "King." He is reclaiming his ancestral property and accepting the "dangerous charge" that comes with his identity. Gandalf recognizes this by "bowing" as he presents it.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn's claim is based on *lineage* and *right*, not on wizardly skill. He explicitly acknowledges his need for Gandalf's counsel ("do not use it - yet!").

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s sigh and his admission that his own heart "desires to test my will upon it" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The universal nature of the Palantír’s temptation, where even the "Wise" and the "White" feel the pull of a "forbidden" vision of lost beauty and the desire to master an ancient, superior art.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf confesses that he, too, is drawn to the Stone. His desire is for "Tirion the Fair"—a vision of the Elven paradise. This shows that the Stone’s power is not just about malice; it exploits the desire for beauty and knowledge. Gandalf’s sigh is a recognition of his own limitations and the "perilous" nature of the things he must protect the world from.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gandalf’s desire is to *see* Tirion through the glass, not necessarily to go there immediately. His primary mission remains in Middle-earth, and his admission is a moment of self-reflective vulnerability.

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s observation that "oft evil will shall evil mar" provides a thematic summary of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The inherent self-sabotage of malevolence, where the competing desires and "greedy" impulses of evil agents (like Pippin’s "folly" saving Gandalf from a "blunder") inadvertently contribute to their own downfall.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf notes that he was saved from his own "grave blunder" by Pippin's "folly." If Gandalf had looked in the Stone, he would have been revealed. Instead, Sauron only saw a "captive hobbit" in Isengard. This "strange turn of fortune" is a result of Wormtongue's spite and Pippin's curiosity, proving that the internal chaos of evil can produce beneficial results for the "good."

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The King is "marvelling" at the events and his comment is a general proverb about the nature of the war, rather than a reflection on his own location.

### Question 8 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The sudden appearance of the winged Nazgûl over the camp at Dol Baran serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Escalate the narrative tension and physical urgency, transforming the "restful night" into a state of immediate, high-speed flight and signaling the beginning of the final, open phase of the war.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Nazgûl is the "messenger of Mordor." Its presence signifies that the time for "leisurely" travel is over. Gandalf cries "Ride, ride! Wait not for the dawn!" This shifts the pace of the book into a "perilous" and high-speed mode. It visualizes the "storm" coming from the East and forces the Company into a desperate race against the "shadow over the moon."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The messenger is sent to "find out what [Saruman] is doing," rather than acting as a reinforcement force. Its primary narrative role is to provide a "shock" that spurs the characters into their next destination.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s decision to take Pippin with him on Shadowfax primarily represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A proactive measure to secure the "vulnerable" element of the Company (Pippin) and to use the wizard's own speed and power to outrun the "expectation" of the Eye, while providing the hobbit with a direct, protective guidance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf says it will be "better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep." He knows Pippin is the "focus" of Sauron's attention right now. By taking him on the "swiftest horse," Gandalf keeps the "object of interest" close to himself and removes it from the slower-moving Riders, effectively acting as a high-speed bodyguard for the traumatized hobbit.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Gandalf has already "forgiven" Pippin. The ride is presented as a necessary tactical move for Pippin's safety and the speed of the mission ("Hope is in speed!"), rather than a punitive measure.

---

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s final feeling—that he and Gandalf were "still as stone... while the world rolled away beneath his feet"—symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The mythic and transcendent quality of their flight on Shadowfax, where the individual characters become fixed, almost iconic figures within an epic movement of time and geography that is now out of their control.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "still as stone" imagery suggests a state of "monumental" endurance. They are no longer just people; they are the "White Rider" and his charge, moving at a supernatural speed. The "rolling away" of the world emphasizes the scale of the journey and the sense that they are now part of a grander, "wind-driven" destiny that transcends their personal physical movement.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Pippin hears the "great noise of wind," indicating he is aware of the *immense speed* of the horse; the "stillness" he feels is a psychological and mythic perception of his own person relative to the blur of the landscape.
