### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s song about the "wet and cool" stream, and his subsequent riddle about the fish, reveals that his primary sensory delight is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A purely primal, biological focus on immediate physical relief and raw nourishment, which acts as a temporary psychological refuge from the "cold hard lands" of his own guilt and memory.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum’s song focuses on his physical discomfort ("bites our hands," "gnaws our feet") and the relief of "wet and cool" water. His riddle about the "juicy-sweet" fish shows that his interior life has shrunk to the most basic animal needs. This "biological" focus is his primary mode of existence, allowing him to ignore the "Shadow" and his own "misery" for a few moments of sensory pleasure.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he calls the fish "sweet," he uses "Precious" specifically for the Ring throughout the chapter. The fish is a physical desire, but it is distinct from the spiritual obsession he has with the Ring.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s reaction to the *lembas* ("Dust and ashes, he can't eat that. He must starve") reinforces the idea that:**

**Correct Answer: B. Gollum’s internal corruption is so absolute that he is physically incapable of receiving "goodness" or "life" in any form, viewing the holy sustenance of the Elves as a source of choking and death.**

**Why this is correct:**
Similar to his reaction to the Elven-rope, Gollum finds the "waybread" offensive to his senses. He calls it "dust and ashes." This suggests that his spiritual state has altered his biology; he is now aligned so closely with the Shadow that anything "fair" or "pure" acts as a literal poison to him. His "starvation" is both physical and spiritual.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
His reaction—"spitting," "spluttering," and a "fit of coughing"—is described as a visceral, involuntary physical response rather than a calculated social performance. He truly cannot eat it.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s realization that "are we ever likely to need bread again?" when discussing the food supply suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A somber, sacrificial focus on the singularity of the mission, where the expectation of a "return" or a future has been entirely discarded in favor of a final, one-way journey into the Fire.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is being brutally realistic. He recognizes that the Quest is likely a suicide mission ("who knows what will come of that?"). His dismissal of the need for "bread" after the job is done shows his complete commitment to the "end." He is no longer planning for a life after the Ring; he is living only for the moment of its destruction.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While he is weary, his comment is presented as a philosophical and strategic conclusion about the nature of the "last stage," rather than a temporary side-effect of the Ring's influence on his appetite.

### Question 4 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Dead Marshes, where "dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up... like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers," creates an atmosphere of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A morbid, stagnant preservation of death, where the landscape acts as a chronological "trap" that holds the remains of the past in a state of eternal, unhealed decay.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "ragged shadows" and "long-forgotten summers" suggest a place where time has stopped in its most unpleasant form. The marshes do not just destroy; they "swallow up the graves" and keep them "rotting." This creates a sense of profound stagnation and un-naturalness, where the past refuses to pass away and become healthy earth again.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text uses words like "noisome," "stifling," "scum," and "livid," characterizing the environment as an "evil-smelling" and "cursed" place rather than a peaceful one.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s vision of the "pale faces, deep deep under the dark water" and his observation of "weeds in their silver hair" indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic leveling effect of war and the "Shadow," where the nobility of Elves and Men has been reduced to the same state of "foul" and "rotting" nothingness as their enemies, preserved only as a ghastly spectacle of loss.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo sees "Men and Elves, and Orcs beside them." This is the ultimate horror of the Marshes: in death and "shadow," the fundamental moral and racial differences between the combatants are erased. They all lie "deep deep" in the same "foul" mud. The "silver hair" of the Elves being filled with "weeds" emphasizes the desecration of the "noble" by the "Shadow."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gollum explicitly states, "Only shapes to see... All dead." The horror comes from the *stagnation* and the "fell light" within the dead, not from an immediate threat of physical attack.

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s explanation of the "Candles of corpses" ("Don't look! Don't follow them!") suggests that the primary danger of the lights is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A spiritual and psychological "lure" that exploits the traveler's curiosity or despair, drawing them away from the "path" and into the "gurgling mud" of permanent, spiritual stagnation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum calls them "tricksy lights." Frodo is found "standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights." This indicates that the lights exert a hypnotic, pulling power. Following them leads to "join[ing] the Dead ones," suggesting that the primary peril is the loss of will and the abandonment of the "safe path" in favor of the "shadow."

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While the marshes "reek," the specific danger of the *lights* is their "tricksy" and seductive quality, rather than a biological toxicity. They represent a spiritual rather than a chemical threat.

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s reaction to the "winged shape"—lying on the ground as if he had been "stunned" and refusing to lift his face—indicates that:**

**Correct Answer: B. A total psychological collapse before the absolute "visibility" and surveillance of the Enemy, whose agents (the Nazgûl) represent an omnipresent and inescapable power that makes his own "sneaking" feel futile.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum waails that "They see everything... Nothing can hide from them." For a character whose entire survival is based on "sneaking" and remaining "unseen," the realization that the Wraiths "tell Him everything" is a source of absolute terror. His collapse is a manifestation of his feeling of spiritual and physical nakedness before the "Red Eye."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gollum’s reaction is one of "terror" and "cowering," and he "curses the White Face" (Moon) because it helps them see. He views the Wraiths as absolute masters to be feared, not as allies.

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s growing sense of the "Eye"—as a "hostile will" that strives to "pin you under its deadly gaze"—characterizes the conflict as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A high-stakes "war of wills" where the primary pressure is psychological and ontological, threatening to strip the individual of their privacy and autonomy through absolute, malicious observation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo feels the Eye's "potency beat upon his brow." The "veils" are becoming "thin." This emphasizes that the true danger of Mordor is not just physical Orcs, but the spiritual pressure of a single, massive Will that seeks to "see you" and render you "immovable." The conflict is centered on Frodo’s ability to maintain his internal "self" against this external, crushing gaze.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The narrative presents the Eye as an objective, spiritual reality ("as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun") that both Frodo and Gollum feel, rather than a subjective delusion or paranoia.

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The country before the gates of Mordor, described as an "obscene graveyard" of "fire-blasted and poison-stained" mounds, serves as a:**

**Correct Answer: B. Final, physical manifestation of the "total" nature of the Shadow’s work, which does not just kill but "defiles" and "diseases" the very earth, leaving a monument of industrial horror that can only be cured by an external, elemental cleansing.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text calls it a "lasting monument to the dark labour." It is a land "diseased beyond all healing." This goes beyond normal "waste" or "desert"; it is an active, "poison-stained" desecration of the natural world. It serves as a visual and sensory summary of Sauron’s goal: the transformation of Middle-earth into a "dead country" of ash and "vomit."

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "horror," "loathing," and "sickness." There is no humor in the description of this "land of disease."

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The "debate" Sam overhears between Smeagol and Gollum—alternating between "nice hobbit" and "Baggins stole it"—reveals that:**

**Correct Answer: B. The radical, internal fragmentation of a soul under the influence of the Ring, where the vestigial morality of "Smeagol" is being systematically dismantled by the predatory and power-hungry logic of "Gollum."**

**Why this is correct:**
The "pale light" (Smeagol) and "green light" (Gollum) in his eyes visualize this internal battle. Smeagol tries to hold on to the "promise" and the "nice hobbit," while the Gollum-voice uses the language of "Mastery" and "Baggins hatred" to encourage betrayal. This shows that Gollum is not a monolithic villain but a site of ongoing spiritual conflict, where the Ring is the primary driver of his "madness."

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While they *sound* like two people, the text emphasizes they use "the same voice," characterizing it as an internal "debate" or a "split" within a single, fragmented personality.
