### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s thought during the ascent to the Citadel—"this is a tunnel leading to a tomb; there we shall stay for ever"—characterizes his state as:**

**Correct Answer: B. The lingering, "dream-like" residue of the Black Breath, where the physical effort of the climb is filtered through an internal landscape of despair and the expectation of death.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry is "weary" and "full of pain." He describes the ascent as a "meaningless journey in a hateful dream." His thought about the "tomb" reflects the spiritual "shadow" cast by the Witch-king. The physical world of the City is being over-written by the psychological "coldness" of his wound, making the very stones of Gondor feel like a final, inescapable trap.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Merry's thought is a *fear* and a manifestation of his *exhaustion* and the "Shadow," rather than a deliberate, conscious plan. He is "swayed and murmured as one in sleep," showing he is not in full control of his own narrative.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Ioreth’s mention of the old lore—"The hands of the king are the hands of a healer"—serves narratively to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Introduce the "High" diagnostic criterion for true kingship, framing Aragorn’s return not just as a military conquest but as a restorative and legitimizing act of biological and spiritual renewal.**

**Why this is correct:**
This piece of folklore provides the "proof" that Denethor demanded. Aragorn’s ability to heal the "Black Shadow" is a power that the Stewards lack. It shifts the definition of "King" from a mere wielder of a sword to a restorer of life. By having an "old wife" speak the lore, the author emphasizes that true wisdom is often preserved in the most humble and overlooked cultural traditions.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Ioreth is described as being "too busy... to heed all the crying," and her focus is on the *well-being* of Faramir and the *ancient legend*, rather than any political allegiance to the Stewards.

---

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s decision to stay outside the City in a tent, despite being the "Renewer," is motivated by:**

**Correct Answer: B. A high-stakes diplomatic and moral caution, prioritizing the internal unity of the defense and the legal legitimacy of his claim over his own personal "glory" or immediate comfort.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn explicitly states he fears "doubt and debate may arise." He knows that entering as a King while the City is in trauma could be seen as an act of opportunistic "supplanting" (as Denethor feared). By staying outside and entering only as a "Captain of the Rangers" to heal, he avoids a political conflict and lets his *deeds* establish his right to the throne.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he is "unused to cities," his primary reasoning is presented as a strategic and moral consideration for the "City and realm" and his desire to avoid "strife" during the war.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s analysis of Faramir’s condition—mentioning "weariness, grief for his father’s mood... and over all the Black Breath"—characterizes the wound as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A complex, psychosomatic and spiritual collapse, where the physical wound acted as a gateway for a deeper "Shadow" fostered by emotional trauma and the exhausting moral struggle against his father’s despair.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn notes that the "hurt" was not "deep or vital." The real danger is the "Black Breath" and the "grief." Faramir's "staunch will" was eroded by the "Shadow" long before he was hit by the arrow. This characterizes the conflict as a spiritual one—Faramir was "dying" of his father's loss of hope, and the arrow was merely the physical catalyst for his total surrender.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Aragorn speaks with "pity and honour" and "marvels" at Faramir's strength. He takes the illness with extreme seriousness, noting that Faramir is "nearly spent."

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Herb-master’s dismissal of *athelas* as a "doggrel" and "garbled in the memory of old wives" illustrates a decline in:**

**Correct Answer: B. The loss of "High" lore and its replacement by a sterile, academic intellectualism that can no longer perceive the "virtue" or the spiritual potency inherent in the world’s ancient, sacred elements.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Herb-master is "learned in tongues" but lacks "wisdom." He treats the rhyme as "doggerel" because he cannot measure its effect. This highlights the "declining" state of Gondor—they have the *words* of the past but have lost the *power* and the *faith* that give them meaning. Gandalf's rebuke emphasizes that "less lore and more wisdom" is what is needed in the "last need."

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text presents this "modernization" or academic sterilization as a *negative* decline into "dotage," rather than a positive or neutral evolution of the culture.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "living freshness" and the memory of "dewy mornings" that fill the room when Aragorn crushes the *athelas* represent:**

**Correct Answer: B. The active, spiritual "exorcism" of the Black Shadow through the release of a primordial, unfallen vitality that exists in the "king's hand," restoring the connection between the sick and the world of light.**

**Why this is correct:**
The fragrance is described as "like a memory... of unshadowed sun." This is more than just a good smell; it is an atmospheric shift. It "lightens" the hearts of all who stand by. The *athelas* acts as a conduit for the "Higher" reality of the West, physically displacing the "Shadow of Mordor" and bringing the "freshness" of the beginning of the world into the "diseased" room.

**Why E is incorrect** `[CC]`:
The text notes that *all* present felt the lightness and heard Ioreth's exclamation, characterizing the change as an objective, shared reality of the room rather than an individual delusion of Sam's.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s first words upon waking—"My lord, you called me. I come. What does the king command?"—signify:**

**Correct Answer: B. A moment of total, intuitive recognition and unreserved allegiance, where the "Steward" immediately perceives and accepts the returned royal authority that his father spent his life denying.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir wakes with a "light of knowledge and love." He does not ask who Aragorn is; he simply calls him "lord" and "king." This provides the moral and legal resolution to the Stewardship. Faramir's "true" Numenorean spirit recognizes its master without need for "proof." This act of "High" humility contrasts sharply with Denethor's "proud" refusal to "step down."

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he is eager, he explicitly asks for the "king's command," framing his desire for action as an act of *obedience* to a higher authority rather than a purely personal or frantic impulse.

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s description of Éowyn as a "white flower... and yet knew that it was hard, as if wrought... out of steel" captures:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic "frozen" state of her character, where her natural vitality and "proud" nobility have been petrified by unreturned love and the "ignoble" duty of watching her uncle’s decay.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn analyzes her "malady" as beginning "far back." The "frost" that turned her "sap to ice" is her own despair at being "trapped." Her "steel" quality is her strength of will, but it is a cold, defensive strength that she used to endure her "cage." Aragorn recognizes that her body is being destroyed by the "anguish" of a spirit that has found no outlet for its " High" desires.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Denethor's "sternness" was rooted in "pride and despair" and a desire for "Mastery." Éowyn's "hardness" is a manifestation of her *frustrated* heroism and her "pity" for Théoden, representing a different kind of spiritual suffering.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s initial refusal to smoke—"I shan't ever be able to smoke again without thinking of him"—marks a moment of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The weight of personal grief and the "holiness" of memory, where a simple domestic habit is temporarily paralyzed by its association with a lost, beloved figure and the "broken" promises of the past.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry links his pipe to Théoden's promise to "talk herb-lore." The death of the King has "brought it all back." This is a realistic portrayal of how grief "pollutes" even the most joyful parts of life. Merry's reluctance shows the depth of his love for Théoden; his "Shire-heart" is now burdened with the "High" sorrows of the world, making his old habits feel painful rather than restorative.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Merry's subsequent smile and decision to "smoke and think" when encouraged by Aragorn prove that his essential hobbit nature is still there, but it is now being "refined" by the wisdom of his grief.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s "stern" joke to Merry about the herb-master and the "history of tongues" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Use a familiar, half-humorous "Ranger" persona to ground the hobbit and ease the "unbearable" tension of the day, proving that despite his new "High" kingship, he remains the "Strider" they knew at Bree.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn’s tone—half-scolding, half-joking—is exactly how he treated them in Book 1. By mocking the Herb-master's pedantry, Aragorn signals to Merry that the world has not changed *so* much that they cannot still "jest" together. This helps Merry transition out of his "dismal" state and provides a sense of continuity and "homely" friendship in the midst of the City's trauma.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Aragorn prefaces his joke by "kissing Merry" and ends it by wishing that the Shire "live for ever unwithered," characterizing his "sternness" as a form of affectionate, masculine camaraderie rather than arrogance.
