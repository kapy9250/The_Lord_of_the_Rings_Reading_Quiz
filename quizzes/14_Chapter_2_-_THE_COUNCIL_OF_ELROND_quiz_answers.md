### Question 1 `[SCA/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Elrond’s statement that the Council members have been "called" even though he himself did not summon them suggests a worldview where:**

**Correct Answer: B. The characters are operating within a framework of providential design or "fate," where apparent coincidences are actually the manifestation of a higher, ordering purpose.**

**Why this is correct:**
Elrond explicitly says, "Believe rather that it is so ordered." This introduces the concept of "unseen ordering," a recurring theme in Tolkien's work. The "very nick of time" arrival of messengers from the Dwarves, Elves, and Men is not seen as random luck but as a sign that the world is being guided toward a necessary resolution by a power greater than the "Great" themselves.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Elrond's tone is one of gravity and humility, acknowledging a power *higher* than his own wisdom, rather than trying to elevate his own status.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Boromir’s initial reaction to the news that Isildur took the Ring ("If ever such a tale was told in the South, it has long been forgotten") primarily reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The cultural and historical isolation of Gondor, where the lived reality of war has superseded the preservation of ancient, seemingly "lost" lore.**

**Why this is correct:**
Boromir represents a nation that has been on the front lines of a "War of the Ring" for centuries without knowing the Ring exists. His reaction shows that Gondor's history has become localized and pragmatic; they remember the "Dark Lord" but have forgotten the specific details of his defeat. This sets up the tension between Gondor's military perspective and Rivendell's lore-based perspective.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While he later suggests using the Ring, his *initial* reaction is "wonder" and a realization of his own ignorance regarding "tidings" that the North has preserved.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**What does Gandalf’s description of Saruman’s "Many Colours" robes suggest about Saruman’s transformation?**

**Correct Answer: B. Saruman has abandoned the purity and unified focus of his original mission ("White") in favor of a fragmented, ambitious, and ultimately self-serving complexity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman claims that "white light can be broken," to which Gandalf replies that it is "no longer white." This is a philosophical debate about the nature of wisdom. Saruman believes that "breaking" and diversifying leads to power and "Knowledge, Rule, Order," while Gandalf sees it as a betrayal of the fundamental "path of wisdom." The "shimmering" and "bewildering" colors represent Saruman's loss of a singular, moral center.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While he does scoff at "Gandalf the Grey," the "Many Colours" change is presented as a significant, self-proclaimed evolution of his own identity, rather than just a comparison to Gandalf.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s explanation of the Rangers' role ("If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be, and we must be secret to keep them so") defines his character as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A tragic, self-sacrificing guardian who accepts anonymity and lack of gratitude as the necessary price for protecting the innocent’s peace of mind.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn explains that the Rangers receive "less thanks" and "scornful names" like "Strider." He accepts this because his mission is to preserve the "peace and freedom" of the simple folk by keeping the darkness secret. This characterizes him as a selfless hero who values the *result* of his labor (the safety of the Shire) more than his own reputation or recognition.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
He calls the folk "simple," but he does so with a sense of protective care, wishing to keep them "free from care and fear." He doesn't look down on them; he views their simplicity as something worth preserving at his own expense.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Boromir’s suggestion to use the Ring as a weapon ("Wielding it the Free Lords of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy") highlights a fundamental disagreement regarding:**

**Correct Answer: B. The nature of evil and power, specifically whether a malevolent instrument can be used for good without corrupting the user.**

**Why this is correct:**
Boromir's argument is purely military and pragmatic: Gondor needs a weapon to win. Elrond's rebuttal is moral and ontological: the Ring is "altogether evil" and its "very desire... corrupts the heart." This is the central ideological conflict of the Council—the temptation to use the Enemy's power to defeat the Enemy, which the Wise recognize as a path to becoming a new Dark Lord.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
At this stage, Boromir's motivation is the defense of his city ("Gondor stands"). He doesn't yet desire to be a Dark Lord; he simply doesn't understand the corruptive nature of the Ring as the Wise do.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s response to Saruman’s proposal ("only one hand at a time can wield the One... do not trouble to say _we_!") reveals that Gandalf understands:**

**Correct Answer: B. The Ring’s power is inherently solitary and absolute, making any promise of shared rule a deceptive lie designed to mask a future betrayal.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf exposes the internal logic of tyranny. By saying "only one hand," he identifies that Saruman's use of "we" is a rhetorical trick. The Ring does not allow for a "union of strength" or a committee of the Wise; it demands a single Master. Gandalf's refusal shows he sees the immediate betrayal that Saruman is already planning.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The "one hand" is a metaphor for the absolute nature of the Ring's sovereignty, not a physical limitation.

---

### Question 7 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "astounding" change in Gandalf’s voice when he speaks the Black Speech in Rivendell serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Physically and spiritually manifest the inherent foulness and invasive power of the Enemy's world, forcing the Council to confront the reality of the Shadow they are debating.**

**Why this is correct:**
The reaction of the environment (the shadow passing over the sun) and the Elves (stopping their ears) shows that the Black Speech is more than just words; it is a spiritual contaminant. Gandalf uses it to "put doubt aside" and to jar the Council out of their intellectual debate and into a visceral recognition of the Ring's true nature and its proximity to its Master.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Gandalf speaks it specifically to *warn* and *prove* the Ring's identity, not to join Sauron. His refusal to ask pardon shows he believes the "harsh" shock was necessary for the "safety" of the Council's decision-making.

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Bilbo’s "valiant offer" to take the Ring back himself, and Gandalf’s "pleasant advice" for him to finish his book, suggests that Bilbo's role has shifted from:**

**Correct Answer: A. An active hero to a historical witness, acknowledging the natural limits of his strength and the necessity of passing the burden to a new generation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf points out that "starting is too great a claim for any" and that Bilbo's "part is ended, unless as a recorder." This transition honors Bilbo's past heroism while realistically assessing his current "grown" age and the "grown" power of the Ring. It signifies the end of the "Hobbit" era of the quest and the beginning of the "War of the Ring."

**Why B is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While Bilbo calls himself a "silly hobbit," the Council treats him with "grave respect." Gandalf's advice is "pleasant" because it acknowledges Bilbo's worth while protecting him from a task that is now "beyond [his] strength."

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s feeling that "some other will was using his small voice" when he volunteers to take the Ring suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. His decision is a moment of profound spiritual alignment with a higher "calling" or "fate" that transcends his personal desire for safety and peace.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo has an "overwhelming longing to rest" and a "great dread." His volunteering goes *against* his own natural inclinations. The "other will" is not malevolent (like the Ring's command at the Ford) but a form of "ordained" purpose (as Elrond previously suggested). It represents the moment where Frodo accepts his "fate" as the appointed Ring-bearer.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The Ring wants to be *wielded* or *found*, but Frodo is volunteering to *take it to the Fire*. This is the "path unforeseen" that the Ring would never choose for itself.

---

### Question 10 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Elrond’s final assessment of the quest ("This is the hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise... to shake the towers and counsels of the Great") highlights a central theme of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The paradoxical power of the small, the humble, and the overlooked to effect catastrophic change in a world dominated by "the Great" and their massive power structures.**

**Why this is correct:**
Elrond admits that none of "the Wise" could have foreseen this. The hobbits, who were "no concern" of Saruman and "unnoticed" by Sauron, are now the "appointed" agents of the world's survival. This theme of "small hands" moving the "wheels of the world" is the moral and structural foundation of the entire narrative.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While the Wise were "at fault" (as Gandalf admitted), Elrond’s focus is on the *unexpected emergence* of the Shire-folk as a new force, rather than a definitive statement of his own failure.
