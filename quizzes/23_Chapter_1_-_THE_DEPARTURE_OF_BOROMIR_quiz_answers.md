### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s self-reproach upon hearing Boromir’s horn ("Alas! An ill fate is on me this day, and all that I do goes amiss") reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A moment of leadership crisis where the overwhelming pressure of multiple, simultaneous failures (losing Frodo, Sam, and now Boromir) leads to a temporary lapse into fatalistic despair.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn has just taken command after Gandalf's fall, and in his first major decision point, the Fellowship has completely shattered. His words reflect the psychological weight of "The King returning," where every setback feels like a cosmic judgment on his worthiness. He is "stung" by the realization that his search for Frodo on the hill left his other companions vulnerable.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While he is questioning himself, the narrative presents this as a temporary crisis of confidence that he eventually overcomes when he makes the "right choice" to follow the Orcs.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Boromir’s final words—"I tried to take the Ring from Frodo. I am sorry. I have paid"—characterize his death as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A redemptive sacrifice where the act of confession and the subsequent defense of the "Halflings" restore his honor, turning his individual "fall" into a moral victory.**

**Why this is correct:**
Boromir's tragedy is that he was a good man who succumbed to temptation. His final moments involve an honest confession and a demonstration of his original character: protecting the weak. By saying "I have paid," he acknowledges the justice of his end, allowing him to die with a "smile" because his honor has been reclaimed through his final stand.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text explicitly frames his death as a "victory" (Aragorn’s word). He is not a villain, but a hero who failed and then redeemed himself in the most absolute way possible.

---

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s response to Boromir ("No! ... You have conquered. Few have gained such a victory") suggests a definition of "victory" based on:**

**Correct Answer: B. The internal, moral triumph over the temptation of the Ring and the subsequent restoration of character through self-sacrifice, regardless of the physical outcome of the battle.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn sees past the "failed" mission to the "conquered" heart. Boromir’s victory is not military (he died and the hobbits were taken), but spiritual. He broke the Ring’s hold on his mind by admitting his fault and giving his life for his friends. Aragorn's blessing is a recognition of this "highest" form of victory.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Boromir's prowess is noted ("twenty at least lay there"), Aragorn's emphasis is on his character and his "peace," indicating a deeper meaning than mere kill-count.

---

### Question 4 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The decision to send Boromir down the Falls of Rauros in an Elven-boat, rather than burying him, reflects:**

**Correct Answer: B. A ritualistic return to his ancestral homeland, entrusting his body to the primary geographical symbol of his people’s strength and history, ensuring a "warrior's burial" that transcends physical limitations.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn chooses the River because it is the "River of Gondor." By giving Boromir to the water, he is effectively sending him home. The legend mentioned at the end of the scene—that he "passed through Osgiliath"—shows how this choice transforms a practical problem (no time for a grave) into a mythic homecoming for a fallen prince.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The decision is presented as a somber, respectful choice intended to prevent "evil creature[s]" from "dishonouring his bones," rather than a matter of boat management.

---

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The presence of the "S-rune" and the "small white hand" on the strange Orcs leads Aragorn to conclude that:**

**Correct Answer: B. A third power has entered the war, one that mimics the methods of the Enemy but pursues its own autonomous and treacherous agenda, effectively shattering the "West’s" internal security.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn identifies the "White Hand" as Saruman's device. This confirms that Saruman is no longer a neutral observer but an active participant with his own "Uruks of Mordor" (actually Uruk-hai). This discovery complicates the political landscape, showing that the Fellowship is being hunted by two distinct, and perhaps competing, dark masters.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn's analysis is based onheraldry and lore (the use of white and elf-runes), linking the Orcs directly to Isengard.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "funeral song" for Boromir, specifically the refusal to ask the East Wind for tidings, illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The symbolic association of the East with Mordor and the Enemy, representing a psychological and cultural refusal to acknowledge or find "voice" in the direction of pure evil.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn says, "In Minas Tirith they endure the East Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings." This cultural detail shows how deeply the Shadow has marked the minds of the Men of the West. The East is the source of "unending" threat; to ask it for news would be to invite the Enemy's own narrative. The song remains incomplete, mirroring the "broken" status of the Company.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Gimli's refusal is a respectful adherence to the "lore" and "custom" of Aragorn's people, showing his solidarity with the Men of Gondor in their grief.

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s analysis of the footprints at the shore ("A hobbit waded out into the water and back") leads him to the "brave deed" of Frodo, which he identifies as:**

**Correct Answer: B. Frodo’s voluntary assumption of total isolation and his decision to shoulder the "death" of the quest alone to spare his friends, marking a final shift from Company member to solitary martyr.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn recognizes that Frodo left "without a word" to protect them. He understands that Frodo’s "sudden resolve" was an act of "brave" self-sacrifice—accepting the loneliness of Mordor so that his friends might find a "safe road." This acknowledges Frodo's growth from a "child" needing protection to a leader making his own agonizing choices.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Aragorn explicitly says Frodo was "off East" and had "gone to Mordor," correctly interpreting that the Ring-bearer has finally embraced his ultimate mission.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**What is the primary factor in Aragorn’s "right choice" to follow the Orcs rather than Frodo?**

**Correct Answer: B. A prioritized moral duty toward the living captives (Merry and Pippin) whose fate he can still influence, compared to the "appointed" fate of the Ring-bearer which has now moved beyond his control.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn says "the fate of the Bearer is in my hands no longer." He recognizes that Frodo has made his choice and is "safely on his way" (with Sam). His "heart speaks clearly" that his current duty is to prevent the "torment and death" of the hobbits who were taken. This marks his transition from being the Ring’s guardian to being a leader of Men and a rescuer.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn's decision is framed as a moral and ethical dilemma (abandoning captives vs. following the Ring), rather than a question of his technical skills.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The naming of the trio as "The Three Hunters" at the end of the chapter signifies a shift in the narrative genre from:**

**Correct Answer: B. A protective, reactive mission of "guardianship" to a proactive, relentless pursuit of justice and rescue, emphasizing the renewed focus and martial energy of the remaining Fellowship.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "Fellowship" has broken, but the "Three Hunters" are born. This new title signals a change in the story’s pace and tone. They are no longer hiding and "drifting"; they are "tireless and swift," actively hunting the enemy. This re-energizes the narrative after the heavy grief of Boromir’s death, turning a moment of defeat into a new, focused mission.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The story remains high fantasy and epic; the shift is in the *mode* of action (flight to pursuit), not in the overall dramatic tone.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s decision to keep Boromir’s last words about Frodo "secret" for a long time suggests:**

**Correct Answer: A. His desire to protect Boromir’s reputation and the morale of the Company by burying the details of the "madness" that contributed to the Fellowship’s breaking.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn knows that the truth of Boromir's attack on Frodo would be devastating to Legolas and Gimli, and would tarnish Boromir’s "victory" over the Orcs. By keeping it secret, Aragorn allows Boromir’s final heroic act to stand as his primary legacy, showing Aragorn’s wisdom as a leader and his "kindly pity" for his fallen comrade.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Aragorn's silence is presented as a deliberate, tactical choice ("Aragorn did not say"), indicating he remembers the words very well but chooses not to speak them.
