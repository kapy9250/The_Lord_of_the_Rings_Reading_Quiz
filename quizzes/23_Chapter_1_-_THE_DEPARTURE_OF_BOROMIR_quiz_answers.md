### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s self-reproach reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A moment of leadership crisis where the simultaneous failure of his protective duties (losing Frodo, Sam, and Boromir) leads to a lapse into fatalistic despair.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn has just taken command. The Fellowship's breaking feels like a judgment on his worthiness. His words reflect the psychological weight of the "King returning." He is "stung" by the realization that his search for Frodo left his other companions vulnerable.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "physical training."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects "betrayal by Sam."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about a "trap by Saruman."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "letting Boromir lead."

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Boromir’s final words characterize his death as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A redemptive sacrifice where the act of confession and the defense of the "Halflings" restore his honor, turning a moral fall into a spiritual victory.**

**Why this is correct:**
Boromir's tragedy is that he succumbed to temptation. His final moments involve an honest confession and a demonstration of his original character: protecting the weak. By saying "I have paid," he acknowledges the justice of his end, allowing him to die with a "smile" because his honor has been reclaimed.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Over-Interpretation" about the "blood of Numenor becoming thin."
- **C** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "poorly timed tactical admission."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "fear of Aragorn’s judgment."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "blaming the Ring."

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s response to Boromir suggests a definition of "victory" based on:**

**Correct Answer: B. The internal triumph over the Ring’s psychological hold and the restoration of personal integrity through self-sacrifice.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn sees past the "failed" mission to the "conquered" heart. Boromir’s victory is not military, but spiritual. He broke the Ring’s hold by admitting his fault. Aragorn's blessing is a recognition of this "highest" victory.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "casualty rates."
- **C** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "inspiring Gondor."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" calling it a "polite lie."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about "facilitating Frodo's escape."

### Question 4 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The decision to send Boromir down the Falls reflects:**

**Correct Answer: B. A ritualistic "homecoming" that entrusts his body to the primary geographical symbol of his people, reclaiming him from the "shadow" of his fall.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn chooses the River because it is the "River of Gondor." By giving Boromir to the water, he is sending him home. This choice transforms a practical problem (no time for a grave) into a mythic homecoming for a fallen prince.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "lack of respect."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "water-spirits and new life."
- **D** is a "Half-Truth" about "attracting Orcs."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "not trusting the earth."

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The presence of the "S-rune" leads Aragorn to conclude that:**

**Correct Answer: B. A third power has entered the conflict, one that mimics the methods of the Enemy but pursues an autonomous and treacherous agenda.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn identifies the "White Hand" as Saruman's device. This confirms Saruman is no longer a neutral observer but an active participant. This discovery complicates the political landscape, showing two distinct dark masters.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "new heraldry for Sauron."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "mercenaries from Bree."
- **D** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "branding Orcs."
- **E** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "S standing for South."

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "funeral song" for Boromir illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A symbolic refusal to find "voice" or hope in the direction of the Shadow, representing the psychological and cultural insulation Gondor maintains.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn says they "endure the East Wind, but do not ask it for tidings." This shows how deeply the Shadow has marked their minds. The East is the source of threat; to ask it for news would be to invite the Enemy's narrative.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "poetic incompetence."
- **C** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "wind strength."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "surprise attacks."
- **E** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Bilbo’s thievish wind."

**Aragorn identifies the "brave deed" of Frodo as:**

**Correct Answer: B. Frodo’s voluntary assumption of total isolation to spare his friends the "death" of the quest, marking his final transition to a solitary martyr.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn recognizes that Frodo left to protect them. He understands that Frodo’s "resolve" was an act of self-sacrifice—accepting the loneliness of Mordor so his friends might find a "safe road."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Half-Truth" about "outrunning Uruk-hai."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "hobbit-heritage telepathy."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about "packing bags."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about Frodo's "power."

### Question 8 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The primary factor in Aragorn’s "right choice" is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A prioritized moral duty toward the living captives whose fate he can still influence, recognizing that the Ring-bearer’s "appointed" fate is now beyond his control.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn says "the fate of the Bearer is in my hands no longer." He recognizes Frodo has made his choice. His "heart speaks clearly" that his duty is to prevent the "torment and death" of the hobbits who were taken.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "incapability."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "fear of revealing identity."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about "honourable tasks."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "circling back."

**Correct Answer: B. A proactive, relentless pursuit of justice and rescue, re-energizing the narrative after the heavy grief of the Fellowship’s breaking.**

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "psychological thrillers."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "satire on hunting."
- **D** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "nature-documentary."

**Correct Answer: A. A wise and compassionate leadership tactic intended to preserve Boromir’s heroic legacy and protect the group’s morale.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn knows the truth of the attack would tarnish Boromir’s final stand. By keeping it secret, he allows Boromir’s heroism to stand as his primary legacy, showing Aragorn’s wisdom and pity.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **B** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "inability to process."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "lack of trust."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about "contagious madness."
