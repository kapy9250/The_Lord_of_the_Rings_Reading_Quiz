**Correct Answer: B. The vast disparity between the "temporary" world of mortal politics and the deep, slow time of nature, where even the "New Age" is a passing season.**

**Correct Answer: B. The danger of "crooked" speech persists even when physical power is gone, as psychological manipulation remains a threat to even the unhasty.**
