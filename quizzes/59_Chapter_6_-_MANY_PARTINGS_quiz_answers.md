### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Arwen’s statement to Frodo that Bilbo "possesses this thing [the Ring] longer than you" and "awaits you, for he will not again make any long journey save one" conveys:**

**Correct Answer: B. A somber, biological reality where the destruction of the Ring has accelerated the aging process for its former bearers, identifying Bilbo’s "next journey" as the inevitable approach of death.**

**Why this is correct:**
Arwen explains that the "power of that thing... is now passing away." Bilbo was sustained by the Ring for decades. Once its influence was gone, his true age (129) began to catch up with him. Her comment about the "long journey save one" is a gentle but clear reference to his impending death, characterizing the end of the Ring's power as the return of natural mortality to its former possessors.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Arwen is explicitly *supporting* Frodo's desire to leave and providing him with a gift for his journey, rather than trying to keep him in Rivendell.

### Question 2 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Arwen’s gift to Frodo—her "choice of Luthien" and the chance to "pass into the West" in her stead—represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme act of high-noble compensation, where the Queen of Gondor recognizes Frodo’s permanent spiritual "wounding" and offers her own ancestral right of passage as the only possible cure for his "weariness."**

**Why this is correct:**
Arwen recognizes that Frodo has been "woven" into the fate of the Elfstone and Evenstar. She offers him her place on the ship to the West ("in my stead you shall go"). This is a profound gift of "healing" for his "hurts" and "memory of the burden." It acknowledges that Frodo’s sacrifice was so great that he can no longer find peace in the mortal world, identifying him as an "honorary" immortal.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The gift is a *conditional* right of passage ("when the time comes, and if you then desire it") for a "Ring-bearer," rather than a literal biological transformation into an Elf. He remains a hobbit, but one with an Elven "way out."

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s refusal to fight Éomer, saying "You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the Morning," illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A sophisticated, aesthetic reconciliation where racial and personal disputes are dissolved into a shared, melancholic appreciation for the different "lights" of Elven beauty, marking the end of their previous quarrel.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli uses the "Morning" (Galadriel) and "Evening" (Arwen) metaphors to resolve his dispute with Éomer. He acknowledges that both are beautiful in their own way. This characterizes the Dwarf as a figure of high-order aesthetic sensitivity. The "foreboding" that his love will "pass away for ever" reflects the Dwarf’s recognition of the Elves' departure, turning his former aggression into a sad, shared wisdom.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Gimli explicitly states "my love is given to the Morning [Galadriel]," maintaining his loyalty to his first "Lady" while using his sophisticated comparison to "excuse" Éomer's different choice.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s formal gift of the Druadan Forest to Ghan-buri-Ghan and the command that "no man enter it without their leave" signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. A radical act of de-colonization and legal recognition, where the returned King restores the autonomous territory of an indigenous people, honoring their "wild" service through a formal grant of perpetual privacy.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn uses his first act of territorial sovereignty to protect the Wild Men. By giving them the forest "to be their own for ever," he reverses centuries of "hunting" and exclusion. This characterizes the "New Age" as one of restorative justice, where the King's authority is used to secure the freedom of the most marginalized and "un-Great" of his subjects.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text says "hereafter let no man enter it," which is the *opposite* of a plan to use the Wild Men as an active military or border guard for Gondor. It is a grant of isolation and autonomy.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The song of the Riders at Théoden’s burial—moving the hearts of those who "did not know the speech"—primarily highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The universal and transcendental power of "High" heroic mourning, where the emotional truth of sacrifice and ancestral continuity bypasses linguistic barriers to create a shared, mythic experience.**

**Why this is correct:**
The slow voices of the Riders "stirred the hearts" of everyone present. This illustrates how the "Song" of Rohan—focused on "doubt," "dark," and "long glory"—reaches a level of authentic human tragedy that is universally understood. It validates Théoden's life as one that has become a "marvel among the Three Kindreds," dignifying his death through the collective act of remembrance.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The song celebrates Théoden as "mighty" and "high lord," and the poem "Out of doubt, out of dark" emphasizes his role as a rekindler of hope, characterizing his life as one of significant and "long glory."

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Treebeard’s comment that "Never is too long a word even for me" and his focus on the "lives of trees" indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The vast, ontological disparity between the "temporary" world of mortal politics and the deep, slow time of the natural world, where even the "New Age" of Men is viewed as a passing season.**

**Why this is correct:**
Treebeard corrects Aragorn's use of "Never." For an Ent, "kingdoms" are relatively brief things. This highlights the "High" botanical perspective of the forest-herds. They exist on a timescale that makes human history seem like a series of "hasty" events. It reinforces the theme that nature's endurance is of a different order than that of human political structures.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Treebeard’s tone is one of "thoughtful" and "unhasty" reflection on the nature of time itself, rather than a personal or petty desire to humiliate the King.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s observation that Saruman "had still one tooth left... the poison of his voice" warns that:**

**Correct Answer: B. The inherent danger of "crooked" speech persists even when physical power is gone, illustrating that the Wizard’s primary weapon—psychological manipulation—remains a threat to even the most "unhasty" minds.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf guesses that Saruman "persuaded" even Treebeard. This shows that Saruman's true "wizardry" was always his voice. Even as a "draggled rat," he can still use the "soft spot" in a good heart to gain his freedom. It characterizes evil as a persistent, communicative poison that does not require "metal and wheels" to cause mischief.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Gandalf’s warning is based on the fact that Saruman *has not* changed; he has only "withered" and becomes more "bitter," using his remaining "tooth" to secure his escape for further mischief.

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Saruman’s mockery of the hobbits as "urchins" who have "all you want" while he is a "beggar" represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A final, bitter projection of his own greed and pride, where he uses the "mask" of poverty to attempt a moral inversion, characterizing the hobbits' success as a form of "theft" from his own ruined life.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman claims the pipe-weed was "mine, mine... repayment in token." He tries to make the hobbits feel guilty for their own comfort. This is the final stage of his corruption: he has become a "beggar" in spirit, unable to accept a gift without turning it into a "claim." He views the world through a lens of perpetual grievance and "spite," mocking the very "mercy" that allowed him to go free.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Saruman's "cracked and hideous" laugh and his kicking of Wormtongue prove that he is as arrogant and cruel as ever, despite his "rags of grey or dirty white."

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of the Elves sitting under the stars, "memorials of forgotten things" who "looked from mind to mind," signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The transition of the "Elder Race" from active historical agents to silent, semi-spiritual figures of memory, whose existence is now more internal and telepathic than engaged with the material world.**

**Why this is correct:**
The narrator compares them to "grey figures, carved in stone." Their "converse" is silent. This visual and spiritual stillness indicates that the Elves are already becoming "un-Seen." They are withdrawing from the "fields of Men" and entering a state of meditative preparation for their departure. It is a haunting image of a civilization that has finished its work and is now becoming its own memorial.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text says they are "recalling the ages that were gone" and "holding council," emphasizing the *importance* and the "High" quality of their memories and their shared thoughts.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Bilbo’s "cosy" and "sleepy" state in Rivendell, and his comment that he "evidently came back by much too straight a road," reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound, late-life detachment from the "Great" world he helped save, where his own past "trip" is now viewed through a lens of gentle, domestic irony and a preference for the "lighted inn" over the "long Road."**

**Why this is correct:**
Bilbo calls himself "silly" and finds the "Great" events (oliphaunts, towers, golden trees) "confusing." His focus has returned to the "cosy" fire and "good" food. This illustrates the final "domestication" of his character. He is no longer a hero of legend but an "ancient" hobbit who is "getting very sleepy," finding his ultimate meaning in the simple comforts of "evening-rest."

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Bilbo calls his accounting of the story "splendid" and "wonderful," and he is "puzzled" but not regretful. His irony is directed at the *scale* of the new story compared to his own, rather than a rejection of his own adventures.
