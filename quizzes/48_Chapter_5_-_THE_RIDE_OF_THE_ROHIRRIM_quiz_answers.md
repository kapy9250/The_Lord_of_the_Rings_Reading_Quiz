### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s internal question—"why he had been so eager to come, when he had been given every excuse... to stay behind"—reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological "aftermath" of a heroic choice, where the romanticized image of war is replaced by the crushing reality of physical exhaustion, social isolation, and the weight of imminent doom.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry is "tired," "lonely," and feeling like "baggage." The "ever-deepening gloom" of the Dawnless Day has "weighed down his heart." This illustrates the realistic, non-romantic side of Tolkien's heroism: the moments of doubt and physical misery that occur *between* the grand acts of service. It humanizes Merry by showing that his courage must be constantly maintained against his own natural desire for comfort and safety.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he is afraid, the text attributes his mood to "loneliness," "exhaustion," and the "weight of Middle-earth." He is not "cowardly" (as he sheathes his sword later and prepares for battle), but he is suffering from the intense psychological pressure of his situation.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Elfhelm’s description of the Woses (Wild Men) as "remnants of an older time... wild and wary as the beasts" characterizes them as:**

**Correct Answer: B. An indigenous, "pre-historical" human culture that has survived the rising and falling of empires by retreating into the "wild," possessing a deep, biological knowledge of the land that exceeds that of the "Tall Men."**

**Why this is correct:**
Elfhelm notes they are "woodcrafty beyond compare" and live "secretly." They are the "Pukel-men" of Dunharrow brought to life. This emphasizes the deep, stratified history of Middle-earth. The Woses represent a "primitive" but vital human strain that operates outside the "High" political structures of Gondor and Rohan, yet remains essential for their survival in this hour of need.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While Elfhelm uses the word "beasts" as a comparison for their wariness, Ghan-buri-Ghan’s subsequent dialogue proves they are a sophisticated, speaking, and self-governing people who "count many things," refuting any "sub-human" characterization.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Ghan-buri-Ghan’s response to Éomer—"Wild Men are wild, free, but not children"—indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A prideful assertion of his own intellectual and cultural dignity, rejecting the "civilized" Man’s tendency to equate a simple, natural lifestyle with a lack of sophisticated perception or adult responsibility.**

**Why this is correct:**
Ghan is responding to Éomer’s questioning of his knowledge. By stating they are "not children," he asserts that his "wild" nature does not mean a lack of wisdom or capability. He "counts stars" and "men in the dark." This challenges the prejudice of the "Stone-house folk" and establishes Ghan as a leader with his own form of "High" intellectual authority and self-respect.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While he mentions "counting," the primary function of the quote is to defend his *dignity* and the *validity* of his culture's knowledge against Éomer's skepticism, rather than just boasting about math skills.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Wild Man’s request—"do not hunt them like beasts any more"—highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic history of persecution and dehumanization the Woses have suffered at the hands of the "higher" human cultures, where their "help" is now traded for the most basic right to exist un-harassed.**

**Why this is correct:**
Ghan’s condition for help is not gold, but to be "left alone." This reveals a dark side of Rohan's (and perhaps Gondor's) history—they have "hunted" these people in the past. It underscores the moral complexity of the "Free Peoples," showing that even the "Good" side has committed acts of exclusion and violence against those they did not understand.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Ghan explicitly wants to "go back to sleep in the wild woods," emphasizing his desire to maintain his traditional, isolated way of life rather than leaving it.

### Question 5 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s decision to accept the Wild Man’s offer, despite leaving "a host of foes behind," reveals a strategic philosophy of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A total, high-stakes commitment to the primary objective, recognizing that in an apocalyptic war, local tactical risks are irrelevant compared to the survival of the central civilization.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden reasons that "if the Stone-city falls, then we shall have no returning." He understands that this is the final battle. The Orcs on the road behind them are a secondary concern; if Minas Tirith is lost, Rohan is lost regardless of their local victories. This "all-or-nothing" strategy is the hallmark of his restored, decisive leadership.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The decision is presented as a calculated and "wise" acceptance of a necessary risk ("We will receive your offer") rather than an act of "recklessness." He recognizes the strategic logic of cutting off the larger host.

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The discovery of the dead errand-riders, including Hirgon still "clasp[ing] the Red Arrow," signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, "mute" tragedy of missed communication, where the physical token of Gondor’s despair is found too late to provide the hope of an answer to the one who sent it.**

**Why this is correct:**
Hirgon died while "fleeing westward," meaning he was unable to reach Denethor with the news that help was coming. This creates a heartbreaking dramatic irony: Gondor is falling in despair, believing they are alone, while their allies are only leagues away. The Red Arrow, still in the dead man's hand, is a symbol of an urgent call that was answered but whose answer was never "heard" by the caller.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text emphasizes the "alas" and the "despair" of Denethor, focusing on the *tragedy of the silence* rather than a comparison of equestrian speed.

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Widfara’s observation of the "sea-tang" in the wind indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A sensory-based "omen" of hope, where the change in the physical atmosphere signals the approaching "unlooked-for" help from the South (Aragorn), marking the beginning of the turning tide against the Shadow.**

**Why this is correct:**
In Tolkien's world, the wind often brings spiritual tidings. A "breath out of the South" with a "sea-tang" is a hint of the arrival of the "Grey Company" by the sea. Widfara’s sensitivity to the air provides the first genuine glimmer of "new things" and "dawn" before the physical light arrives, shifting the mood from one of "doom" to one of "haste."

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Widfara is an inhabitant of the "open Wold" (inland), so the "sea-tang" is an *extraordinary* and "strange" scent for him, characterizing it as a supernatural or distance-spanning message rather than a normal part of his local climate.

### Question 8 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s transformation—seeming to "shrink down, cowed by age" before the "great boom" and then springing "suddenly erect"—symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, climactic "re-awakening" of the King, where the physical shock of the City’s fall triggers a final, explosive release of his heroic will, transforming him into a mythic figure of "new fire."**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden’s moment of hesitation at the smell of burning is his last moment of "mortal" fear. The "boom" of the Gate's fall acts as a call to his blood. His sudden "erect" posture and his "loud voice" mark his transition from a weary old man to a "fey" and unstoppable force of nature. It is the final "shaking of the boughs" mentioned earlier.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
His reaction is one of "tall and proud" leadership and the recitation of a battle-chant ("Arise, arise!"), indicating a profound spiritual and martial alignment rather than a simple emotional irritation.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Théoden’s charge—where he is "borne up on Snowmane like a god of old... even as Orome the Great"—elevates the battle to:**

**Correct Answer: B. A transcendent, cosmological event where the King of Rohan becomes a literal avatar of the first light, reenacting the primordial defeat of the Shadow through a moment of "fey" and absolute martial perfection.**

**Why this is correct:**
The narrator uses the "Orome" simile to move the story into the realm of the *Silmarillion*. Théoden's "golden shield" becomes an "image of the Sun." This is not just a cavalry charge; it is a "Eucatastrophe" in motion—the sudden return of the ancient, divine light to a world that was "un-dawned." It characterizes the Rohirrim as the instruments of a literal, solar redemption.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "fair and terrible" majesty. The comparison to the "Great in the battle of the Valar" is intended to emphasize the *seriousness* and the *epic scale* of the moment, rather than being humorous.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Rohirrim "singing as they slew" characterizes their battle-fury as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A communal, "ecstatic" state of heroic resolve, where the act of warfare is transformed into a sacred, vocal ritual of cultural identity and joy, providing a powerful counter-point to the "wailing" of the Orcs.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "joy of battle" and the "fair and terrible" singing represent the Rohirrim's highest cultural achievement: the synthesis of death and song. For them, the charge is not a chore but a fulfillment of their "oaths." Their song is a physical and spiritual weapon that "removes the darkness" by asserting their own vibrant and unbowed existence.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text contrasts their "fair and terrible" singing with the "wailing" and "terror" of the Orcs. The singing is a sign of their *human* vitality and their alignment with the "light," rather than a "cruel" or animalistic blood-lust.
