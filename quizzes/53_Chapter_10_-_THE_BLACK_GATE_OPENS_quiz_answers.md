### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s advice to Merry reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A sacred opportunity for "earning honour" tailored to each person’s fortune, where peril is a necessary stage for moral and spiritual validation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn tells Merry his "deed" has already earned him honor. He frames Pippin's upcoming journey not as a chore, but as a "chance of peril" that Pippin needs to match Merry's own success.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The act of replacing the king's head signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The restoration of the unfallen, "White" cultural order over the "Black" mockery of the Enemy, asserting the foundation of the past for the justice of the present.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn's restoration of the original head, "still crowned with flowers," is a profound symbolic victory. It shows that the "Lords of Gondor" have returned not just to fight, but to reclaim and wash clean their history.

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s refusal to assail Minas Morgul is motivated by:**

**Correct Answer: B. A high-stakes commitment to the "secret" mission of Frodo, where even a major military victory is sacrificed to avoid attracting surveillance toward the path of the Ring.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf's primary concern is "the Ring-bearer." He prioritizes the "unimportant" hobbit over the "Great" goal of taking the enemy city, demonstrating his commitment to the hidden path.

---

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s "pity" reveals a kingship that:**

**Correct Answer: B. Possesses a profound psychological empathy, recognizing the gap between the "simple life" and the "hideous dream" of the Shadow, offering a path of redirected honor.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn doesn't execute the men for desertion; he gives them a task they *can* achieve. This characterizes his kingship as "White"—based on an understanding of individual capacity.

---

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Mouth of Sauron characterizes his service as:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total erasure of individual identity and moral autonomy in the service of absolute evil, where the "man" has been hollowed out until he exists only as a functional extension.**

**Why this is correct:**
By forgetting his own name, he has lost his soul. He is the ultimate contrast to the "High" Men of Gondor who define themselves by their lineage.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s silent "striving" represents a confrontation of:**

**Correct Answer: B. Sovereign spiritual authority, where the unmasked presence of the returned King exerts an irresistible pressure on the corrupt soul of the servant.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "Mouth" quails because he recognizes (subconsciously or otherwise) the return of the absolute authority he betrayed. It is a battle of "Right" vs. "Cunning."

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s reaction primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Provide a final, agonizing "testing" of the Captains’ resolve, while playing into the Mouth’s own arrogance before the final rejection.**

**Why this is correct:**
By appearing "defeated," Gandalf forces the Enemy to reveal his hand and tests his own companions' "hardihood to die free."

---

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Sauron’s terms reveal his ultimate goal to be:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total, absolute vassalage of the human world, where the symbols of past resistance are re-appropriated as engines of a localized and inescapable tyranny.**

**Why this is correct:**
The terms require Gondor to become "tributary." Sauron doesn't just want to kill his enemies; he wants to turn them into slaves who "govern their own affairs" only within his dark framework.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s rejection of the terms identifies the negotiation as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A moral refusal to engage with evil on its own terms, asserting that the Quest is an un-hagglable absolute that cannot be compromised.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf refuses to "waste words" with a "slave." This defines the "White" strategy: you do not negotiate with the "accursed." The Quest's goal is non-negotiable.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s final thoughts represent:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, paradoxical "release" of the heroic spirit at the moment of final sacrifice, where the acceptance of "death" becomes a source of spiritual lightness.**

**Why this is correct:**
Pippin has "mastered himself." This "gaiety" is the highest stage of his character arc. He has moved from a "foolish" boy to a "valiant" man of Gondor.
