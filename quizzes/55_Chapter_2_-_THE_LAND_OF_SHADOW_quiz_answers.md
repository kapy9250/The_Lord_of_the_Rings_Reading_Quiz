### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A state of internal "narrowing," where the spiritual weight of the Ring has rendered physical safety irrelevant, making any other protection seem like an intolerable distraction.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is "tired, weary." His rejection of armor is not a tactical move, but a sign of his psychological surrender to the singular reality of his burden. The internal "killing" weight of the Ring makes physical safety feel pointless.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the "thorny bushes" suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A perversion of nature, where the power of growth has been "twisted" into an aggressive and agonizing architecture of pain that mirrors the Shadow's malice.**

**Why this is correct:**
Nature in Mordor is "harsh" and "twisted." The thorns are described as "claws." This highlights the theme that the Shadow "mocks" the natural world by turning its elements into tools of "torment."

---

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s inability to remember the Brandywine reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The spiritual "erasure" caused by the Ring, where the internal sanctuary of memory is being overwritten by the encroaching nothingness of Mordor.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is losing his "anchors." The "blind dark" is occupying his internal psychological space. This isolation of the soul from its own past is the final stage of the "wraith-process."

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "cry of woe" signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The turning tide of the larger war, providing a moment of "unseen" dramatic irony where the hobbits' isolation is punctured by global news.**

**Why this is correct:**
The narrator notes the cry "no longer held any terror." This provides the reader with a glimpse of the Enemy's setback elsewhere, connecting the hobbits' lonely struggle to the global victory.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction to the star marks a moment of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A spiritual epiphany that recognizes the ontological priority of "Light and beauty" over the temporary and derivative nature of Evil.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam realizes that the Shadow is "small and passing." This fundamental shift in perspective allows him to find "hope" in the existence of a "High" reality that the Shadow cannot touch.

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Cirith Ungol highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic shift from a proactive defense of the West to a static state of imprisonment under the Enemy’s rule.**

**Why this is correct:**
The reversal of purpose—from a watch-tower *against* Sauron to a prison *for* his slaves—symbolizes the "Long Defeat." It illustrates how the Shadow perverts the structures built to contain it.

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s insistence regarding Gollum suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A realistic assessment of Gollum’s obsession, which makes him reliable only because his greed is incompatible with Sauron’s possession.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo relies on Gollum's *vice* (greed) as a form of "faithfulness." This is a cold, "ring-borne" logic, showing how the Quest must now use the very corruption it seeks to destroy.

---

### Question 8 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The overheard quarrel between the Orcs represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The pervasive and self-destructive "spirit of Mordor," where internal hatreds consistently undermine the Enemy’s objectives.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Orcs' quarrel perfectly mirrors the fight in the Tower. Even when the hunt is hot, their own "rebel-talk" leads to mutual betrayal, proving evil's greatest weakness is its lack of fellowship.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s decision to hide his lack of food illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The absolute, self-effacing nature of his stewardship, where his survival is subordinated to the maintenance of the Bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s silence protects Frodo from the guilt of consuming the last resources. It characterizes his love as a total and silent devotion, the ultimate act of "un-Great" sacrifice.

---

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of the hobbits' escape symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The "un-Great" but essential triumph of the small, where their insignificance allows them to bypass the turmoil of the Great Powers.**

**Why this is correct:**
The hobbits escape by "crawling." This is a visual summary of the whole Quest: while "Big" armies clash, the "Little People" move through the "mud" unnoticed to reach the final goal.
