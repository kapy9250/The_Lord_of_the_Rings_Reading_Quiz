### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to throw away his orc-mail, saying "The Ring is enough. This extra weight is killing me," reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A state of extreme, internal "narrowing," where the spiritual and physical weight of the Ring has become the absolute center of his existence, making all other forms of protection seem like intolerable distractions.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is described as being "tired, weary, I haven't a hope left." His rejection of the armor is not a tactical move, but a sign of his psychological surrender to the singular reality of his burden. The Ring's weight has become "all-consuming." He no longer cares about "knives and stray arrows" because the internal "killing" weight of the Ring has rendered physical safety irrelevant.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While he *does* feel "much lighter" afterward, the decision is presented as a result of his existential exhaustion and the "foul work" of carrying the Ring, rather than a planned strategic improvement in speed.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the "thorny bushes" in Mordor—with thorns "a foot long" that are "tough as wire and as clinging as claws"—characterizes the land’s nature as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A perversion of nature, where the regenerative power of growth has been "twisted" into a malevolent, aggressive, and agonizing architecture of pain that mirrors the Shadow's own malice.**

**Why this is correct:**
In Mordor, nature is not dead, but "diseased" and "harsh." The thorns are described using the language of weapons ("wire," "claws," "stabbing"). This highlights the theme that the Shadow "mocks" the natural world by turning its living elements into tools of "torment." The "clinging" and "tough" nature of the briars mirrors the persistent and agonizing nature of the Shadow itself.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "struggle," "pain," and "blind shadows." The description is intended to evoke the physical and spiritual "unfriendliness" of the environment, rather than a humorous comparison to the Shire.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s feeling that the "blind dark seems to be getting into my heart" and his inability to see the Brandywine in his mind reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The progressive spiritual "erasure" caused by the Ring and the Shadow, where the internal sanctuary of his memories is being overwritten by the encroaching nothingness of Mordor.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is losing his "anchors." His inability to visualize the Water or the Shire is a sign of his "wraith-process." The "blind dark" is not just external; it is occupying his internal psychological space. This isolation of the soul from its own past is the final stage of the Ring's triumph, leaving him with nothing but the "wheel of fire" in his mind.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text presents this not as a medical loss of memory, but as a spiritual and "heart-felt" encroachment of the "Dark" into his core identity, characterizing it as a moral and ontological crisis.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "cry of woe and dismay" from the Nazgûl flying high above signifies to the reader (though not fully to the hobbits) that:**

**Correct Answer: B. The turning tide of the larger war (specifically the death of the Witch-king), providing a moment of "unseen" dramatic irony where the hobbits' isolation is punctured by a global shift in the balance of power.**

**Why this is correct:**
The narrator notes that the cry "no longer held any terror... it was a cry of woe and dismay." This provides the reader with a glimpse of the events on the Pelennor (the "ill tidings for the Dark Tower"). It connects the hobbits' lonely struggle to the epic-scale victory of their friends, offering a subtle but powerful signal that "something is happening" outside Mordor.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The cry causes the hobbits to "cower" initially, but its *tonal* shift from "terror" to "woe" is an objective narrative signal of the Enemy's setback, rather than a tactical lure by the Nazgûl.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction to the "white star" twinkling among the cloud-wrack—feeling that "the Shadow was only a small and passing thing"—marks a moment of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme, spiritual epiphany that transcends his personal situation, recognizing the ontological priority of "Light and high beauty" over the temporary and derivative nature of Evil.**

**Why this is correct:**
This is one of the most famous passages in the book. Sam's heart is "smitten" by the beauty of the star. His realization that the Shadow is "small and passing" is a fundamental shift in perspective. It allows him to put away his "fear" and find "hope" not in the success of the mission, but in the existence of a "High" reality that the Shadow cannot touch. It is his ultimate spiritual victory.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
On the contrary, the star's beauty is what *breaks* the Ring's hold on his mind, allowing his "own fate" to "cease to trouble him." It is a moment of external grace that restores his internal spirit.

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Tower of Cirith Ungol as a place built "not to keep enemies out of Mordor, but to keep them in" highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic shift from a proactive, outward-looking defense of the West to a static, inward-turning state of imprisonment and surveillance under the Enemy’s rule.**

**Why this is correct:**
The narrator explains the history of the Tower: it was built by Gondor after the Last Alliance to "keep watch on the evil land." Its reversal of purpose—from a watch-tower *against* Sauron to a prison *for* his slaves—symbolizes the "Long Defeat." It illustrates how the Shadow occupies and perverts the very structures built to contain it, turning Gondor's "vigilance" into its own engine of control.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "aghast" realization and "shock," emphasizing the strategic and historical tragedy of the Tower's fall rather than any humorous intent.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s insistence that "I'd rather have Gollum than orcs" because "he won't give us away to them" suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A realistic assessment of Gollum’s absolute, singular obsession with the Ring, which makes him a reliable ally only in the sense that his greed for the "Precious" is fundamentally incompatible with Sauron’s possession of it.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo understands that Gollum is "held" by the Ring. Gollum's desire to keep the "Precious" for himself is the only thing that prevents him from betraying the hobbits to the Eye. This is a cold, "ring-borne" logic: Frodo relies on Gollum's *vice* (greed) as a form of "faithfulness," showing how the Quest must now use the very corruption it seeks to destroy.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Frodo's tone is one of "sighing" and grim necessity. He knows Gollum is a "black sneak" and a "murderer," and his preference is a tactical choice of the "lesser evil" rather than a sign of genuine trust.

### Question 8 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The overheard quarrel between the soldier-orc and the tracker-orc, ending in the soldier’s death, represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The pervasive and self-destructive "spirit of Mordor," where internal racial and professional hatreds consistently undermine the Enemy’s own strategic objectives through mutual betrayal and violence.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Orcs' quarrel—about "snufflers" vs. "fighters" and "lugburz" vs. "tower"—perfectly mirrors the fight between Shagrat and Gorbag. Even when the "hunt was hotter... than we guessed," the Orcs' own "rebel-talk" and "fear and rage" lead them to kill each other. It confirms Frodo's later observation: "orcs have always behaved like that," proving that evil's greatest weakness is its own internal lack of fellowship.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The scene is one of "harsh and loud" voices, "cursing," and a fatal arrow to the eye. It is a brutal demonstration of the "malice" that permeates Mordor, rather than a humorous interlude.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s decision to hide his own lack of food and water from Frodo—"Sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop"—illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The absolute, self-effacing nature of his "Higher" stewardship, where his own biological survival is entirely subordinated to the physical and psychological maintenance of the Ring-bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam gives Frodo the "additional wafer" and the water while "Sam's share" is already gone. This is the ultimate act of "un-Great" sacrifice. Sam views himself not as a co-traveler but as a "servant" whose only job is to get "Master" to the end. His silence about his own suffering protects Frodo from the guilt of consuming the last of their resources, characterizing his love as a total and silent devotion.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text explicitly frames his actions as a result of his "hopeful spirit" and his "love" for his master ("I'd carry you... if I could"), rather than a desire for control or dishonesty.

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of the hobbits' escape from the road—"crawling away out of the turmoil" until they "dropped over the further edge"—symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The "un-Great" but essential triumph of the small and the unnoticed, where their very insignificance and "crawling" nature allow them to bypass the "turmoil" of the Great Powers and reach their final destination.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "turmoil" is the massive movement of Orc armies. The hobbits escape by "crawling on hand and knee." This is a visual summary of the whole Quest: while the "Big" armies of Sauron and the West are clashing in "jeopardy," the "Little People" move through the "mud" and the "shadow" unnoticed. Their "drop over the edge" is their final entry into the heart of the Enemy’s realm, achieved through their "littleness."

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "despair," "struggle," and "weariness." Frodo "pitched down" like a "dead thing," emphasizing the extreme physical and psychological cost of their escape rather than any humorous intent.
