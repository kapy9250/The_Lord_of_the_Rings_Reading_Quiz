### Question 1 `[SCA/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Bree as a place where Men and Hobbits live together in a "peculiar (but excellent) arrangement" primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Establish Bree as a rare model of cross-cultural integration and mutual dependence, contrasting with the more segregated societies found elsewhere.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that "nowhere else in the world was this... arrangement to be found." This sets Bree apart as a unique social experiment in Middle-earth, where different races coexist peacefully. This integration is crucial for the plot, as it explains why Shire-hobbits would feel somewhat comfortable there, while still being "Outsiders" to the local population.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text focuses on the uniqueness of Bree rather than providing a direct critique of the Shire. While Shire-hobbits are described as taking "very little interest" in Bree, the primary purpose of the passage is to describe the culture of Bree itself.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction to the "tall houses" and his feeling that his "heart sink" upon seeing the inn most likely reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound culture shock and a realization of the intimidating scale of the world outside the "tame" and diminutive Shire.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s "heart sink" is a reaction to the "three storeys and many windows." For a hobbit accustomed to the ground-level holes of the Shire, the scale of Bree's architecture is a physical manifestation of the larger, stranger world he has entered. It represents the psychological transition from the "homelike" Shire to the "too much" reality of Men and their works.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
There is no evidence here that Sam believes Big Folk are "naturally more evil." His reaction is to the *scale* and *unfamiliarity* of their dwellings, which makes him feel small and exposed.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Barliman Butterbur’s "endless stream of talk" and his constant tapping of his forehead ("One thing drives out another") suggest that his character is:**

**Correct Answer: B. An overwhelmed but fundamentally well-meaning individual whose mind is a chaotic reflection of the busy "meeting of ways" that he manages.**

**Why this is correct:**
Butterbur is described as being "run off my feet" and having "no time for talking" (ironically, while talking). His character is defined by the bustle of the inn. The tapping of the forehead and the "one thing drives out another" phrase indicate a mind that is constantly reacting to the immediate needs of a crowded common-room, rather than one engaged in deep plotting or deception.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While Butterbur *is* more important than he looks (according to Tom Bombadil), his chaotic behavior is consistently presented as a genuine result of being a busy innkeeper in a "crowd," rather than a calculated facade.

### Question 4 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The introduction of Strider—sitting in the shadows, mud-caked boots, and "keen grey eyes" watching the hobbits—functions to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Create a sense of ambiguous threat and expertise, contrasting the "weather-beaten" reality of the Wild with the naive cheerfulness of Pippin and Sam.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider is the visual antithesis of the cheery Bree-hobbits. His mud-caked boots and "keen grey eyes" mark him as a man of action and hardship. His presence in the shadows creates a narrative "mystery"—is he a friend or a foe? This tension serves to remind the reader that the "pleasant" atmosphere of the inn is still part of a dangerous world.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text mentions the "squint-eyed southerner" as an "ill-favoured fellow," but it doesn't hint at a connection with Strider. In fact, Strider's "keen" gaze and Stern face set him apart from the more overtly untrustworthy-looking travellers.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s warning to Frodo ("stop your young friends from talking too much") reveals his primary concern to be:**

**Correct Answer: B. The danger of the hobbits' parochial innocence exposing them to the sophisticated and malevolent surveillance present in Bree.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider points out that "this isn't the Shire" and mentions "queer folk" and "even stranger travellers." He recognizes that Pippin’s account of Bilbo’s party is not just a "funny story" in this context, but a potentially fatal leak of information to the "eyes" that are watching the hobbits. He sees the danger that the hobbits, in their high spirits, are completely ignoring.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Strider is specifically focused on the *hobbits'* talk and how it might reveal *their* secrets (the name Baggins). He doesn't seem worried about his own identity being revealed by Pippin, as Pippin doesn't know who he is.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to jump on the table and speak "a few suitable words" is motivated by:**

**Correct Answer: B. A desperate, social "diversion" intended to stop Pippin from revealing the catastrophic truth of Bilbo’s disappearance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is "annoyed" and "alarmed" that Pippin is "drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance." After Strider whispers "You had better do something quick!", Frodo's leap onto the table is a conscious effort to hijack the audience's attention and drown out Pippin's narrative before the name "Baggins" or the Ring can be mentioned.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While the Ring does influence him *after* he is on the table, the initial motivation for getting up there is a tactical decision to save the situation from Pippin's talkativeness.

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The "desire to slip on the Ring" that comes over Frodo while he is on the table, which he feels "came to him from outside," suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. The Ring is sensitive to the presence of external malevolence or surveillance and is attempting to "reveal" itself to its master’s agents.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo's feeling that the suggestion "came to him from outside" hints at the Ring's agency and its connection to the "Shadow" in the room. The Ring exploits his social awkwardness and the presence of the "swarthy" men to create a situation where it can be "found" or seen, working against Frodo's conscious intention to stay hidden.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While he feels "foolish," the text explicitly states the desire was "unaccountable" and felt like it came "from outside," indicating a supernatural or external influence rather than mere stage fright.

---

### Question 8 `[ACN/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The inclusion of the full text of Bilbo’s "Man in the Moon" song serves primarily to:**

**Correct Answer: A. Provide a colorful example of hobbit folklore and Bilbo's specific linguistic creativity.**

**Why this is correct:**
The song is a masterful piece of "nonsense" poetry that reflects Bilbo's (and Tolkien's) love for language and whimsical imagery. It anchors the scene in the "Shire-culture" that Frodo is bringing with him, providing a moment of levity and character-building before the disastrous disappearance.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The song *is* long, but its primary purpose is not just to delay, but to set the stage for the leap and the "accident" that follow, while enriching the world-building.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s feeling of being a "fool" after his disappearance and his suspicion of Butterbur’s "fat face" reveal:**

**Correct Answer: A. A growing paranoia and loss of social trust caused by the combination of the Ring’s influence and the genuine danger of his situation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s suspicion of "old Butterbur's fat face" is a sign of his deteriorating psychological state. He is becoming unable to distinguish between a busy, well-meaning innkeeper and a "dark designer." This isolation and mistrust are the primary effects of the Ring and the stress of the pursuit, marking a shift from the "friendship" of the previous chapter to a more solitary fear.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
He doesn't think Butterbur is a Black Rider, but he suspects him of "concealing dark designs," which is a more generalized and paranoid form of mistrust.

---

### Question 10 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The departure of the "swarthy Bree-lander" and the "squint-eyed southerner" immediately after Frodo’s disappearance indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. That they have recognized the "magical" nature of the event and are moving to report it to their masters (the Black Riders).**

**Why this is correct:**
The "knowing and half-mocking expression" and the fact that they have been "whispering together a good deal" signal that these characters are spies. Frodo’s disappearance is the "proof" they were looking for. Their immediate departure while the rest of the room is in "uproar" shows a focused, malicious purpose that confirms Strider's warnings about "queer folk."

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text says Frodo "slipped, and rolled off the table" because he "leaped... much too vigorously." There is no mention of anyone tripping him; the "accident" was internal to Frodo/the Ring.
