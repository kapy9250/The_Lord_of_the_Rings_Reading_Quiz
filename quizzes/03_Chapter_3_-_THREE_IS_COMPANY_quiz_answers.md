### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s reluctance to leave Bag End, even though he had "privately made up his mind" to do so, primarily illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological weight of finality and the human (or hobbit) tendency to overvalue what is about to be lost.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that "Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than it had for years." This "savouring" of the last summer is a classic psychological reaction to an impending, permanent loss. The familiarity and safety of home become intensely attractive precisely because they are being exchanged for an unknown, dangerous journey.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
There is no evidence Frodo thinks Gandalf is "exaggerating"; in fact, he is "restless and anxious" when Gandalf doesn't return. His reluctance is emotional, not an intellectual disagreement with the danger.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**What does the varying public reaction to the sale of Bag End—ranging from "a nice bit" to "a bargain price"—suggest about the social environment of the Shire?**

**Correct Answer: B. The community is driven by gossip, financial speculation, and deeply ingrained class-based myths.**

**Why this is correct:**
The hobbits' debate over the price and the "notion of the immeasurable wealth" shows a community that is obsessed with the affairs of the prominent Baggins family. Their inability to believe Frodo's "money was running out" highlights how mythological status (Bilbo's treasure) overrides literal economic reality in the Shire's collective mind.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The hobbits are described as "debatable" and "discussing," suggesting curiosity and speculation rather than genuine altruistic concern for Frodo's financial welfare.

---

### Question 3 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The contrast between the "fair summer" and "rich autumn" and the underlying "uneasiness" Frodo feels regarding Gandalf's absence serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Heighten the narrative tension by juxtaposing the peaceful, bountiful surface of the Shire with an invisible, gathering threat.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "fair summer" and "rich autumn" emphasize the Shire’s insulation and apparent safety. By setting Frodo’s growing worry ("September was passing and there was still no news") against this idyllic backdrop, the author creates a sense of "the calm before the storm," making the eventual arrival of the Black Rider more jarring.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he "forgot his troubles for a while," the text emphasizes that his worry returns "before autumn was well under way." The beauty of the summer isn't just a distraction; it's a narrative device.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to walk to Bucklebury, ostensibly for "pleasure" and "training," despite his "restless and anxious" state, most likely hides:**

**Correct Answer: A. A desire to delay the moment of final departure for as long as possible.**

**Why this is correct:**
By choosing to walk "fairly easy" and take a "last look at the Shire," Frodo is extending his time within the familiar borders. This is a form of procrastination born from his reluctance to enter "exile." He is "restless" to be gone but emotionally "unready" to leave the Shire behind entirely.

**Why B is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he "half expected to see Gandalf come striding up," his primary plan (walking for "pleasure") is established even before Gandalf is late, as a way to say a slow goodbye to his home.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**What is the significance of the Gaffer’s shrill and "put out" tone when speaking to the stranger in the lane?**

**Correct Answer: B. The Gaffer is subconsciously sensing the "unpleasant" nature of the stranger and reacting with defensive hostility.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Gaffer's reaction—being "put out," his "shrill" answers, and his feeling of a "shudder"—suggests an instinctive, visceral rejection of the stranger's presence. Even without knowing the stranger is a Black Rider, the Gaffer's "hobbit-sense" detects something profoundly "unnatural" and threatening about the inquirer.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While the "funny" speech is mentioned, the Gaffer's "shudder" and "put out" nature suggest a much deeper, more instinctive fear than mere annoyance at poor manners.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "sudden unreasoning fear" and the "strong" desire to put on the Ring when the Black Rider first appears primarily indicate:**

**Correct Answer: B. The Ring’s ability to exploit moments of vulnerability and fear to exert its influence over the bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text calls the fear "unreasoning" and the desire to use the Ring "strong." This suggests the Ring is not just a tool, but an active participant that "tries" to get Frodo to reveal himself. It exploits his panic to circumvent Gandalf's advice, showing the beginning of its psychological dominance.

**Why D is incorrect** `[CC]`:
The Rider is "sniffing" and "listening," but the text attributes the "desire to get [the Ring] out of his pocket" to Frodo's own internal struggle, catalyzed by his fear, rather than a direct telepathic command from the Rider.

### Question 7 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The inclusion of the fox’s perspective ("There's something mighty queer behind this") serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Provide an external, objective confirmation that the hobbits' behavior is fundamentally uncharacteristic and "queer."**

**Why this is correct:**
By using an animal's perspective, the narrative reinforces how "un-hobbit-like" the quest actually is. If even a fox in the wood thinks it's "mighty queer" for hobbits to sleep under trees, it highlights for the reader the gravity and abnormality of the situation, underscoring that the traditional Shire life has already been left behind.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While it is a whimsical moment, its primary narrative function is to emphasize the "queerness" of the events, not just to provide comic relief.

---

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gildor’s remark that "hobbits are so dull" and the subsequent laughter of the Elves primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Establish a playful, yet distant, dynamic where the Elves acknowledge their vast difference in perspective while remaining friendly.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Elves' laughter is described as lighthearted, and they immediately invite the hobbits to join them. The "dull" comment is a form of ancient, immortal humor—a way of acknowledging that hobbits live in a much smaller, slower world than Elves do, without being genuinely malicious or exclusionary.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The Elves call Frodo a "jewel among hobbits" and treat them with great kindness and respect ("Hail, Elf-friend!"). The "dull" comment is ironic, not a statement of literal contempt.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**What does Gildor’s refusal to explain the nature of the Black Riders ("lest terror should keep you from your journey") imply about his view of courage?**

**Correct Answer: B. He believes that knowing the full truth too early can be psychologically paralyzing for those not yet ready for the "long road."**

**Why this is correct:**
Gildor suggests that "terror" might stop Frodo's journey before it has truly begun. This implies a belief that courage is something that must be built through action and experience; revealing the full, horrific nature of the Nazgûl to a hobbit who has just left his garden would be a "dangerous gift" that might destroy hope.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gildor doesn't think courage is ignorance; he thinks Frodo is "not ready" for the specific knowledge of what the Riders *are*, though he provides enough warning ("deadly," "servants of the Enemy") to ensure Frodo remains cautious.

---

### Question 10 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gildor’s statement, "But it is not your own Shire," challenges the hobbits' fundamental assumption of:**

**Correct Answer: B. Their parochial sense of permanence, safety, and ownership over a world that is much older and larger than they realize.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gildor points out that others were here before and others will be here after. He is deflating the hobbits' ego by reminding them that the "wide world" is indifferent to their fences and their sense of "peace." This marks a major thematic shift from the "safety" of the Shire to the "unending Road" of the wider world.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While true, the focus of the quote is on the *history* and *transience* of the hobbits' presence ("Others dwelt here before... others will dwell here again"), which is a more profound challenge than just a warning about current safety.
