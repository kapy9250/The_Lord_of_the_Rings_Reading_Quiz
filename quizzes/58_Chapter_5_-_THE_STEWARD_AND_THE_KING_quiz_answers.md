### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Éowyn’s statement—"It needs but one foe to breed a war, not two... and those who have not swords can still die upon them"—reflects a worldview of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "heroic realism" that rejects the passive safety of the non-combatant, asserting that in a total war, the refusal to fight is a form of spiritual and physical vulnerability that does not prevent death but merely dishonors it.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éowyn is challenging the Warden's "peaceful" perspective. She argues that war is not a choice made by two sides, but a condition imposed by an aggressor. Her rejection of "gathering herbs only" while the "Dark Lord gathers armies" reflects her belief that life is only worth living if one has the agency to defend it. She views "healing in body" as secondary to the "honour and peace" found in a meaningful death.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
She is in the Houses of Healing specifically because she *was* wounded. Her point is not that healing is impossible, but that it is "not always good" if it means returning to a life of "sloth" and "caged" inactivity while the world is at war.

### Question 2 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s decision to follow the Warden’s counsel ("I should still listen to his counsel... unless in some great need") distinguishes his authority as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A disciplined and "High" stewardship that respects the specialized expertise of others and recognizes that true strength lies in the patient endurance of "dull tasks" rather than in impulsive, self-serving commands.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir’s humility is his "High" quality. He refuses to use his rank as Steward to override the Warden's medical authority. This characterizes his leadership as one based on "lore" and "order" rather than on "will" alone. He uses the phrase "firmness of mind to go on with a dull task" to challenge Éowyn's desire for immediate "war," identifying her restlessness as a form of "waywardness."

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text emphasizes that Faramir *could* command the Warden but *chooses* not to, characterizing his restraint as a sign of his "stern and gentle" character rather than a lack of political will.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "softening" of Éowyn during her conversation with Faramir—described as "a bitter frost... yielding at the first faint presage of spring"—symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological and spiritual "thaw" of her character, where the warmth of Faramir’s empathetic and non-pitying love begins to dissolve the icy, defensive barrier she built around her heart in response to Aragorn’s rejection.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éowyn’s "frost" was a result of her own "torment" and her unreturned love for Aragorn. Faramir’s "grave tenderness" and his recognition of her as "beautiful and sorrowful" provide the first real emotional relief she has felt. The "yielding" of the frost is manifested by her first tear, marking the beginning of her journey away from "seeking death" and toward a return to life.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The narrator frames the "softening" as a positive, restorative event (a "presage of spring"), rather than a negative loss of strength. She is becoming more "whole," not more "weak."

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s gift to Éowyn—the blue mantle set with silver stars that belonged to his mother—serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Formally and symbolically "re-clothe" her identity, identifying her beauty and sadness as a high-noble inheritance while preparing her for her eventual role as a Lady of Gondor.**

**Why this is correct:**
The mantle belonged to Finduilas of Amroth, a woman of "loveliness" and "sadness." By wrapping Éowyn in it, Faramir is physically manifesting his love and his recognition of her "High" nature. It also serves as a cultural bridge—placing the "White Lady of Rohan" within the visual and historical context of Gondor’s own high nobility, symbolically incorporating her into his own lineage.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
On the contrary, Faramir calls her the "White Lady of Rohan," explicitly honoring her original identity while offering her a new, additional role in "fair Ithilien."

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s dream of the "great dark wave climbing over the green lands" while looking at the final shadow of Sauron suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deep, ancestral memory or prophetic "echo" of the fall of Numenor, providing him with a mythic framework to understand the current "total" threat of the Shadow as a recurring historical catastrophe.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir identifies the "mountain of darkness" as something that "reminds me of Numenor." This reveals his "High" Numenorean spirit. His dreams are not random; they are connected to the "foundering" of his civilization. This ancestral perspective allows him to see the "Doom" of Mordor as part of a larger, cosmic cycle of cataclysm and survival, rather than just a local war.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While he describes the wave, he immediately clarifies that it was a "picture in the mind" and that his "heart says nay" to the darkness enduring, showing he is using the dream as a point of *comparison* rather than a literal prediction of a future flood.

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Éowyn’s final resolution—"I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren"—marks her:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound spiritual "Renovation," where she rejects the cold, sterile pursuit of "renown" through death in favor of a life-affirming, generative role that honors her own "High" lineage through preservation rather than destruction.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éowyn’s "winter" has passed. She recognizes that her previous desire for "glory" was a form of "seeking death." By choosing to be a "healer" and to "love all things that grow," she aligns herself with the "White" power of Gondor (Aragorn’s hands). It is a radical rejection of her "cage" through the adoption of a new, positive, and life-centered purpose.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text frames her choice as a liberating "discovery" of self ("And suddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her"), rather than a submissive acceptance of social limits. She is choosing a "High" calling of healing over a "Low" calling of "slaying."

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s refusal to keep the white rod of the Steward, giving it back to Faramir, signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The formal re-establishment of the traditional, balanced order of Gondor, where the King’s return does not abolish but rather validates and secures the legitimate "Trust" of the Stewardship for the future.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Stewardship was always a "trust" held until the King returns. By giving the rod back, Aragorn acknowledges Faramir’s (and his ancestors') faithful service. He establishes a "new" relationship of "High" partnership. The office is "not ended," signifying that the restoration of the King is a completion of Gondor's law, rather than its destruction.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn explicitly says the office shall be "thine and thy heirs'," showing his absolute trust in Faramir and his desire to reward the "Stewardship" that Denethor almost destroyed.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s request that the Ring-bearer bring the crown and Gandalf set it on his head emphasizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. A public and ritualistic acknowledgment of the "unseen" moral and spiritual foundations of his kingship, identifying the "un-remembered" sacrifice of the small and the guidance of the Wise as the true sources of his victory.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn says "In token of this I would have the Ring-bearer bring the crown... and let Mithrandir set it upon my head." This is a profound political and moral statement. He refuses to take the credit for his own restoration. He identifies the "unimportant" hobbit and the "wizard" as the true "movers" of the victory, publicly establishing his kingdom on the basis of humility and "gratitude."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Frodo is honored as the "Ring-bearer," a role that is unique and sacrificial, rather than being given a conventional human political title like "King of the Elves."

### Question 9 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The discovery of the sapling of the White Tree high on Mount Mindolluin symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The miraculous and "appointed" restoration of the kingdom's biological and spiritual life, matching the King’s return with a physical sign of continuity from the beginning of the world.**

**Why this is correct:**
The sapling is a "scion of the Eldest of Trees." Its presence in the "appointed hour" is a sign from the Valar. It confirms that the "withered" state of Gondor is over. The fact that it was "hidden on the mountain" mirrors the race of Elendil being "hidden in the North." The tree's blooming is the final, biological proof of the "New Age" and the return of the world's original "Light."

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "wonder," "reverence," and "rejoicing." The tree is presented as a sacred and near-miraculous artifact of the "Elder Days," with no lighthearted or humorous intent.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s feeling upon seeing Arwen’s arrival—that "now not day only shall be beloved, but night too shall be beautiful and blessed"—suggests that:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total "healing" of the world’s temporal and spiritual cycle, where the beauty of the "Evenstar" redeems the darkness from its association with the Enemy, marking the final expulsion of the "Shadow" from his own heart.**

**Why this is correct:**
For most of the book, "Night" and "Shadow" have been associated with Sauron and terror. Arwen, the "Evenstar," represents a beauty that shines *in* the night. Her arrival at Midsummer (the turn of the year) signifies that the darkness is no longer "foul" or "poisoned." It marks the restoration of the "Evening" as a time of beauty and "peace," reconciling the light and dark halves of Frodo's experience.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
On the contrary, Frodo's statement is about the *beauty of the night* ("night too shall be beautiful"), rather than a wish for perpetual sunlight. He is embracing the "completeness" of the world's new, un-Shadowed state.
