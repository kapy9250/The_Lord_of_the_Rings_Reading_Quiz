### Question 1 `[SCA/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Ithilien as a "garden of Gondor now desolate" that keeps a "dishevelled dryad loveliness" suggests that the land:**

**Correct Answer: B. Exists in a state of suspended, wild grace, where the former human cultivation has been overgrown by nature, creating a beautiful but "perilous" frontier between civilizations.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text describes Ithilien as a land of "climbing woods and swift-falling streams" with many "sweet-smelling herbs" and "trees planted long ago." It is "desolate" (uninhabited by Gondorians) but still "fair-seeming." This "dryad loveliness" represents a state where the beauty of Gondor's past persists in a wild, un-tended form, serving as a lush but dangerous backdrop for the guerrilla warfare of the Rangers.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text explicitly states that Ithilien is "not yet fallen wholly into decay" and is "less barren and ruinous" than the lands near the Gate. It stands in contrast to the "industrial" wasteland of Mordor.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s longing for "something hot out of the pot" and his subsequent decision to cook the rabbits reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological necessity of "home-making" as a form of resistance, where the act of cooking provides a vital, domestic link to his Shire identity that sustains his morale in a hostile land.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam's desire for a "good homely meal" is what drives him to ask Gollum for help. By carrying his "cooking-gear" hundreds of miles, Sam maintains a physical and symbolic connection to his life as a gardener and a hobbit. The act of "stewing these coneys" is a way for him to reclaim a small piece of his own culture in the "shadow" of Mordor, providing the "heart's ease" that he needs to continue.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While it *was* risky, Sam's motivation is presented as a deep-seated emotional and cultural need ("I'm going to risk it, anyhow"), rather than a reckless disregard for safety. He believes the "homely meal" is worth the risk.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s observation of the "light" shining within the sleeping Frodo, which is "clearer and stronger" than in Rivendell, suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. The progressive spiritual "transfiguration" of the Ring-bearer, where the proximity to Mordor and the weight of the task are refining his soul into a luminous, sacrificial, and "ancient" state.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam notes that Frodo's face looks "old, old and beautiful," and that the "chiselling of the shaping years" is revealed. This inner light is a recurring motif in Frodo's character arc. It indicates that as he suffers more under the "burden," his spirit is becoming more refined and "transparent" (as Gandalf noted earlier), marking his transformation into a figure of high moral and spiritual stature.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While he may look "beautiful" like an Elf, the text emphasizes the "lines" and the "old" quality of his face, characterizing the change as a result of his specific *human/hobbit* journey and the "shaping years" of his task.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s fear of the "nassty red tongues" (fire) and his warning that it "will bring enemies" highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. His deeply ingrained "survival of the hider" instinct, where fire represents the ultimate violation of his covert existence and an invitation to the "Eyes" he spent centuries avoiding.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum gives a "thin hissing shriek" at the sight of the fire. For him, safety is synonymous with "darkness" and "cold." The "red tongues" of fire are a beacon that undoes his entire strategy of "sneaking." His reaction shows how his centuries of hiding from the "Yellow Face" and the "Red Eye" have made him pathologically fearful of any form of light.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text notes that he is "both frightened and angry" and that he "squealed in dismay." His concern is selfish and based on his own traumatic history with the "Eye," rather than a sincere, altruistic desire to protect the hobbits.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s realization that his cooking-fire has been "smoking" and his fear that he has "brought trouble" illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic intrusion of his "Shire-innocence" into a high-stakes military reality, where a simple domestic comfort becomes a potentially fatal tactical error.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s "shock" at seeing the "thin spiral of blue-grey smoke" marks the moment his domestic dream (the stewed rabbit) collides with the dangerous reality of Ithilien. He realized that "never thought it would show like that." This mistake highlights the vulnerability of the "simple" hobbit character in a world of professional "Rangers" and "Orcs."

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While it was a mistake, Sam *is* a skilled woodsman (as shown by his ability to make a smokeless fire initially). The "trouble" comes from a small remaining brand that he neglected, emphasizing a momentary lapse in focus due to his "dreaming" rather than a general lack of competence.

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The first appearance of Faramir and his Men—clad in green and brown, hooded and masked—characterizes the Rangers of Ithilien as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A highly specialized and professional guerrilla force that has adapted the "secrecy" of the wilderness to maintain a persistent, "unseen" resistance within territory controlled by the Enemy.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Rangers are "clad in green and brown of varied hues" to "walk unseen." They use bird-calls for communication and move "singly or in long files" in the shade. This characterization establishes them as the "Men of the West" equivalent of the hobbits' own "stealth," but on a professional, military level. They represent Gondor's surviving "lore" of the wild.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The green color is a tactical choice for *concealment* in the "glades of Ithilien," rather than a statement about fashion or general popularity in Gondor.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s start and his "strange stern look" when Frodo mentions Boromir reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. A complex emotional and political reaction, balancing personal familial grief with the shock of meeting "Halflings" from his brother’s own mythic "riddle."**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir's reaction is described as "strange" and "stern." As Boromir's brother, he is hit by the sudden news of him in a "riddle." The fact that these "Halflings" know the words Boromir brought from Rivendell is a "token of your truth" to him. This moment sets up the deep, intuitive bond (and contrast) between Faramir and Boromir that will be explored in the next chapter.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he is suspicious ("you would not have gone far... this day"), his primary reaction to the name "Boromir" is one of "astonishment" and intense focus, rather than an immediate accusation of murder.

### Question 8 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The sound of the battle being compared to "a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Relate the epic violence of battle to a familiar, domestic labor of the Shire, emphasizing Sam's "outsider" perspective while highlighting the cold, "metallic" reality of the clash.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam uses a metaphor from his own life to describe the "ringing grate of steel." This "hobbit-centric" perspective grounds the battle in a sensory experience the reader can understand. It also highlights the "industry" of war—the clashing of "iron caps" and "shields"—reinforcing the cold and mechanical nature of the conflict between these two groups of Men.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While the metaphor is domestic, the tone is one of "astonishment and terror." Sam "did not like it much," showing that the comparison is meant to illustrate the *violence* of the sound rather than provide a joke.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction to the dead Southron warrior—wondering if he was "really evil of heart" or what "lies or threats" led him to war—demonstrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound, humanist empathy that pierces through the "heroic" narrative of war, recognizing the shared humanity and potential victimhood of the enemy combatants.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s "flash of thought" is one of the most significant moral moments in the book. He looks at the dead enemy and sees a fellow man who might have "stayed there in peace." This rejects the "Orc-like" dehumanization of the enemy, recognizing that many who serve the Shadow are themselves "deluded" or coerced. It highlights the "pity" that is central to the hobbit character.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Sam knows perfectly well who the "Enemy" is (he has seen the Black Gate). His reaction is not confusion, but a deep, moral *insight* into the tragedy of human conflict.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s "lasting delight" upon seeing the Mûmak (Oliphaunt) signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate validation of his Shire-folklore and his imaginative capacity, where the terror of the war is momentarily eclipsed by the wonder of seeing a "legend" come to life.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam had just recited the *Oliphaunt* rhyme, and seeing the "vast shape" is a moment of "lasting delight." This reflects the theme of "walking in legends." Even in the middle of a "dreadful feast and slaughter," Sam is able to experience "wonder." This capacity for joy and wonder is his primary spiritual defense against the "Shadow" of despair.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text notes his "astonishment and terror" alongside his delight. He is still very much afraid of the "raging" beast and the "deadly" environment, but his "delight" comes from the *reality* of the creature he previously only knew in song.
