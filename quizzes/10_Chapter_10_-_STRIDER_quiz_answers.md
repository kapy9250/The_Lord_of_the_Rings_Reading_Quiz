### Question 1 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s request for a "reward" in exchange for his help primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Test the hobbits' judgment and their ability to distinguish between a genuine threat and a calculated, perhaps even playful, attempt to secure their cooperation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider’s "slow smile" and his clarification that the reward is "No more than you can afford" (their company as a guide) indicate that he is not actually interested in money. He is using the "rascal" persona to see how the hobbits react to a suspicious figure. This test prepares them for the "lesson in caution" that he later mentions, while also gauging Frodo's perceptiveness.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Strider is explicitly *not* a merchant; he is a Ranger. His request for a "reward" is a psychological tactic, not an expression of an economic worldview.

---

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s reaction to the Black Riders—his face "drawn as if with pain" and his "hands clenched"—reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deep, personal history of trauma or suffering connected to the Riders that transcends mere tactical knowledge.**

**Why this is correct:**
The physical manifestation of "pain" and "unseeing eyes" suggests that the Riders are not just obstacles to Strider, but a source of personal or ancestral sorrow. His remark "They are terrible!" and his moment of "distant memory" indicate that his knowledge of the enemy is rooted in a profound emotional experience of their power and malice.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he *is* frustrated with their carelessness, the description of his "drawn" face and "clenched" hands suggests an internal, emotional agony rather than just temporary social irritation.

---

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s internal conflict between believing Strider is a friend and his suspicion of Strider's "changed" voice illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: A. Frodo’s innate ability to detect shifts in register and tone, indicating a maturing, more skeptical character.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo notices that Strider "began to talk... like the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed." This awareness of linguistic shifts shows that Frodo is no longer the naive hobbit who simply accepts things at face value. He is learning to analyze the subtext of social interactions, a skill necessary for his survival outside the Shire.

**Why B is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Frodo is actually trying to follow Gandalf's advice *too* well (being careful), which leads him to doubt even the person Gandalf told him to look for. His wavering is a sign of his growing caution, not a failure to follow orders.

---

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Barliman Butterbur’s description of Frodo as a "perky chap with a bright eye" based on Gandalf’s letter primarily highlights:**

**Correct Answer: A. Gandalf’s fondness for Frodo and his attempt to provide a description that reflects Frodo’s spirit rather than just his physical appearance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf knows that many hobbits look alike to Big Folk ("stout little fellow with red cheeks"). By adding "fairer than most," "cleft in his chin," and especially "perky chap with a bright eye," Gandalf provides markers of personality and spirit. This description shows Gandalf's intimate knowledge of Frodo's character and his desire to ensure Butterbur can identify him through his "inner light."

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The description is actually quite specific ("cleft in his chin," "taller than some"), showing Gandalf has a *very good* memory for detail, but he chooses to emphasize the "perky" nature as the primary identifier.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**What does Strider’s admission that he "hoped you would take to me for my own sake" suggest about the psychological life of a Ranger?**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound loneliness and a weariness of the social isolation required by his clandestine mission.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider’s "queer laugh" and his comment that a "hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust" provide a glimpse into his internal world. He spends his life in "distrust" and "disguise," and he expresses a poignant desire to be seen and accepted as a person ("for my own sake") rather than just as a tactical asset or a "foul" vagabond.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text presents this as a moment of vulnerability and honesty ("I must admit"), rather than a tactical move. It humanizes Strider and separates him from the "play-acting spy" Sam fears him to be.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s response to Sam’s suspicion ("If I had killed the real Strider, I could kill you. ... If I was after the Ring, I could have it - NOW!") uses:**

**Correct Answer: A. Brutal logic and a display of overwhelming presence to shock the hobbits into recognizing the futility of their distrust.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider "seems suddenly to grow taller" and shows his "keen and commanding" light. By pointing out that he *could* simply take what he wanted by force, he forces the hobbits to realize that their survival depends on his *voluntary* restraint. This paradoxical argument (I am good because I could be evil but choose not to be) is his final proof of character.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he is assertive, the text describes his face being "softened by a sudden smile" immediately after, indicating that his "outburst" was a controlled demonstration of truth rather than a loss of temper.

---

### Question 7 `[ACN/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The inclusion of Gandalf’s poem ("All that is gold does not glitter...") primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Establish a prophetic, mythic framework for Strider’s character, validating his "foul" appearance through a promise of hidden nobility and future renewal.**

**Why this is correct:**
The poem explicitly addresses the discrepancy between appearance and reality ("All that is gold does not glitter"). It connects Strider to the "crownless" king and the "broken" blade, transforming him from a "mud-caked" Ranger into a central figure of prophecy. This elevates the narrative from a fugitive thriller to a high-fantasy epic.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While the poem does warn about appearances, its primary narrative function is to *identify* and *elevate* Strider as the "real gold" despite his lack of "glitter," rather than being a general warning about treasure.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s realization that a spy would "seem fairer and feel fouler" indicates a sophisticated understanding of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological discrepancy between a deceptive, polite exterior and an underlying, intuitive sense of malevolence.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s observation is a direct inversion of Strider’s appearance ("looks foul and feels fair"). It shows Frodo's maturation—he is learning to trust his *feelings* and intuition over his eyes. He recognizes that true evil (like a spy from Mordor) would likely use a "fair" appearance to deceive, whereas Strider’s "foul" exterior is an honest reflection of his hard life.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Frodo isn't making a general rule that *only* foul people are trustworthy; he is specifically analyzing Strider's character and noting that Strider "frightened" him in a way that felt "fair" (honest/protective) rather than "foul" (malevolent).

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "Black Breath" that affects Merry after his encounter with the "deeper shade" in the shadows functions as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A psychological weapon of despair and terror that strips its victims of their will and memory, illustrating the Riders' supernatural nature.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry says he "went to pieces" and had an "ugly dream" he can't remember. He felt he had "fallen into deep water." This describes an internal, spiritual collapse rather than a physical illness. The Black Breath is the Riders' primary weapon: the projection of pure terror that overwhelms the mind, making it a perfect symbol of the "Shadow" they serve.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While it's called a "breath," the text emphasizes the *psychological* effects (the "ugly dream," "going to pieces," "deep water") rather than biological symptoms of poisoning.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s decision to have the hobbits stay in the parlour and create "bolsters" in their beds suggests a tactical shift from:**

**Correct Answer: A. Passive hiding to active, deceptive counter-surveillance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider recognizes that the Riders already know where the hobbits' rooms are. By moving them to the parlour and setting "decoys" (the bolsters and mats), he is using the Riders' own surveillance against them. He is no longer just "avoiding being seen," but is actively manipulating the environment to ensure safety, showing his expertise as a "hunted man."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Strider specifically says the Riders will *not* openly attack a house with lights and people. The decoys are a defensive measure to prevent a "secret" assassination or abduction in the night, not a lure for an open fight.
