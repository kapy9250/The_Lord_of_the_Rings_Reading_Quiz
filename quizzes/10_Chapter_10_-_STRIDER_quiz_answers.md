### Question 1 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s request for a "reward" in exchange for his help primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Test the hobbits' judgment and their ability to distinguish between a genuine threat and a calculated, playful test of their character.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider’s "slow smile" and his clarification that the reward is just "you must take me along with you" indicate that he is not interested in material gain. He is using the "rascal" persona to gauge how the hobbits react to a suspicious figure. This test prepares them for the "lesson in caution" while also allowing Strider to evaluate Frodo's perceptiveness.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" that accepts the "mercenary" mask as truth.
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" that suspects a "secret contract" with the enemy.
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "bitterness" and "wealth" not supported by the tone.
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "manipulation of the Little Folk."

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s reaction to the Black Riders—his face "drawn as if with pain" and his "hands clenched"—reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deep, personal history of trauma or suffering connected to the Riders that transcends mere tactical knowledge.**

**Why this is correct:**
The physical manifestation of "pain" and his "unseeing eyes" suggest that the Riders are not just obstacles, but a source of personal or ancestral sorrow. His remark "They are terrible!" and his moment of "distant memory" indicate that his knowledge of the enemy is rooted in a profound emotional experience of their power.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Lore-Trap" that invents a "Shadow-curse."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" that reduces his pain to "frustration with hygiene/caution."
- **D** is a "Half-Truth"; while he knows the Black Breath, the text suggests a deeper, historical connection to the pain.
- **E** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects him of "theatrical performance."

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s internal conflict between believing Strider is a friend and his suspicion of Strider's "changed" voice illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: A. Frodo’s innate ability to detect shifts in register and tone, indicating a maturing, more skeptical character.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo notices that Strider "began to talk... like the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed." This awareness of linguistic shifts shows that Frodo is no longer the naive hobbit who simply accepts things at face value. He is learning to analyze the subtext of social interactions, a skill necessary for survival outside the Shire.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **B** is an "Over-Interpretation" about a "desire to turn back."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "consistent dialects."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" that suspects the "Ring’s voice."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "social anxiety."

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Barliman Butterbur’s description of Frodo as a "perky chap with a bright eye" based on Gandalf’s letter primarily highlights:**

**Correct Answer: A. Gandalf’s fondness for Frodo and his attempt to provide a description that reflects Frodo’s spirit rather than just his physical appearance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf knows that many hobbits look alike to Big Folk. By adding "perky chap with a bright eye," Gandalf provides markers of personality and spirit. This description shows Gandalf's intimate knowledge of Frodo's character and his desire to ensure Butterbur can identify him through his "inner light."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **B** is a "Plausible Misreading" that mocks Butterbur’s "lack of imagination."
- **C** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "coded language" for "royal lineage" (which Frodo doesn't have).
- **D** is a "Half-Truth" about "Big Folk perceptions" that misses the *affectionate* nature of Gandalf’s words.
- **E** is a "Lore-Trap" that links the "bright eye" to the Ring’s influence prematurely.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**What does Strider’s admission that he "hoped you would take to me for my own sake" suggest about the psychological life of a Ranger?**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound loneliness and a weariness of the social isolation required by his clandestine mission.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider’s "queer laugh" and his comment that a "hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust" provide a glimpse into his internal world. He spends his life in "distrust" and "disguise," and he expresses a poignant desire to be seen and accepted as a person ("for my own sake") rather than just as a tactical asset.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects "vanity."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" that attributes a "tactical" motive to a moment of vulnerability.
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "disillusionment with the Ranger-code."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "moral failure."

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s response to Sam’s suspicion ("If I had killed the real Strider, I could kill you...") uses:**

**Correct Answer: A. Brutal logic and a display of overwhelming presence to shock the hobbits into recognizing the futility of their distrust.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider "seems suddenly to grow taller" and shows his "keen and commanding" light. By pointing out that he *could* simply take what he wanted by force, he forces the hobbits to realize that their survival depends on his *voluntary* restraint. This is his final proof of character.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **B** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" that suspects him of "clever lies."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about being "more dangerous than Black Riders."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "humorous exaggeration."
- **E** is a "Lore-Trap" that attributes his "commanding light" to the Ring.

### Question 7 `[ACN/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The inclusion of Gandalf’s poem ("All that is gold does not glitter...") primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Establish a prophetic, mythic framework for Strider’s character, validating his "foul" appearance through a promise of hidden nobility.**

**Why this is correct:**
The poem addresses the discrepancy between appearance and reality ("All that is gold does not glitter"). It connects Strider to the "crownless" king and the "broken" blade, transforming him from a "mud-caked" Ranger into a central figure of prophecy.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "breaking up the conversation."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about Gandalf being a "disturber of the peace."
- **D** is a "Half-Truth" about "not trusting fair things."
- **E** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about Shire "roots" and "frost."

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s realization that a spy would "seem fairer and feel fouler" indicates a sophisticated understanding of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological discrepancy between a deceptive exterior and an underlying, intuitive sense of malevolence.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s observation is a direct inversion of Strider’s appearance ("looks foul and feels fair"). It shows Frodo learning to trust his *feelings* over his eyes. He recognizes that true evil (like a spy) would use a "fair" appearance to deceive, whereas Strider’s "foul" exterior is an honest reflection of his hard life.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "cleanliness" and "dirt."
- **C** is an "Over-Interpretation" about Strider’s "secret desire."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "Black Riders before corruption."
- **E** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that creates a false rule that *only* foul people are trustworthy.

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "Black Breath" that affects Merry functions as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A psychological weapon of despair and terror that strips victims of their will and memory, illustrating the Riders' supernatural nature.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry says he "went to pieces" and had an "ugly dream" he can't remember. He felt he had "fallen into deep water." This describes an internal, spiritual collapse. The Black Breath is the Riders' primary weapon: the projection of pure terror that overwhelms the mind.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" that suspects a "biological contagion."
- **C** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "Brandybuck-blood."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about "smoke-filled air."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about a "magical illusion by Bill Ferny."

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s decision to have the hobbits stay in the parlour and create "bolsters" in their beds suggests a tactical shift from:**

**Correct Answer: A. Passive hiding to active, deceptive counter-surveillance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider recognizes that the Riders already know where the hobbits' rooms are. By moving them to the parlour and setting "decoys," he is using the Riders' own surveillance against them. He is no longer just "avoiding being seen," but is actively manipulating the environment to ensure safety.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **B** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "holy ground."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about Riders being "easily fooled."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects Strider of "getting more sleep."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about "bolsters as weapons."
