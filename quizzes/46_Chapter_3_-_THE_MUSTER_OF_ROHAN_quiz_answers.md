### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s feeling of being "borne down" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound psychological agoraphobia, where the indifferent, mythic scale of the world becomes a source of existential exhaustion for a creature of domestic proportions.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry finds the "skyless world" of "great walls" overwhelming. For a hobbit rooted in "quiet rooms," the "immensity" is a physical "weight." It captures the feeling of insignificance that characterizes the hobbits' experience of the "Great" world in Book 5.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "tectonic plates."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "ent-draught weight."
- **D** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "lithic."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "ale and altitude."

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s rebuke to Éomer indicates that:**

**Correct Answer: B. He has developed a defensive sensitivity to any counsel of "prudence," viewing it as a spiritual pollutant that threatens his hard-won heroic agency.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden has rejected the state of paralysis he endured under Wormtongue. He identifies "safety" with that state. For him, the choice is now about dying as a King in battle. He views Éomer's concern as a return to the "soft" logic he has discarded.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "irrational suspicion."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "regressing to dotage."
- **D** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "executing commanders."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "Wormtongue as a title."

### Question 3 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the "Pukel-men" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Contrast the Rohirrim’s narrow military focus with the "un-remembered" and mournful history of the land, using Merry’s empathy to highlight the tragedy of transience.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Rohirrim "hardly glanced" at the statues. Merry feels "pity." This highlights the layer-on-layer history. The Pukel-men are remnants of a culture older than Rohan. Their "sad" state serves as a memento mori—a reminder that even great works become "unimportant."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "failed artistic movements."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "magic batteries."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "maintaining monuments."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "statue-games."

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Éowyn’s reaction reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A state of "terminal resignation," where the loss of the figure representing her hope for a mythic life has left her in a spiritual eclipse.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn's choice to take the "Paths of the Dead" is a death sentence in her eyes. But his refusal to let her follow is the final closing of her "cage." Her grief is for her own lost chance at a meaningful destiny.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "joy."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "leading a rebellion."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about "becoming a Wraith."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "metaphor for Gondor."

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s account of the "old man" highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The apocalyptic nature of the current hour, where the "frozen" locks of history are being unsealed by absolute necessity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden muses that "the time foretold has come." The ancient prophecy and the "waiting" of the Dead indicate the world is reaching its final confrontation. The "shut" way is now "open," signifying history is re-activating.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "bureaucratic regulation."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "rude hosts."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about the "Common Tongue."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "public utilities."

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The arrival of the "Red Arrow" and Théoden’s trembling signify:**

**Correct Answer: B. The visceral weight of an ancient "blood-oath" being called in, marking the moment where personal destiny and national survival merge.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Red Arrow is a "summons long expected." It is the physical manifestation of the "Alliance of old." Théoden's trembling recognizes the gravity: Gondor is at its "desperate" end. He rides out of moral necessity.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "physical weakness."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "biological weapons."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "fear of arrows."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "Green Arrows."

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The voices of the trumpets indicate:**

**Correct Answer: B. The atmospheric and spiritual "damping" of hope by the Shadow, where martial symbols are physically stifled by the "un-light" of the Enemy.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "heavy air" and "featureless" cloud literally stifle the sound of hope. This "Dawnless Day" is a weapon of terror, designed to make the Defenders' calls feel "dull" and "ominous," isolating them from natural light.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "lack of training."
- **C** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "melting instruments."
- **D** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "literal vacuum."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "brass instruments."

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s observation of Dernhelm suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. An intuitive recognition of a kindred "Shadow" spirit, identifying the Rider as someone whose internal "cage" has forced them into suicidal desperation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry sees in Dernhelm's eyes a "glint" of despair. Although he doesn't know it's Éowyn, his "shiver" recognizes the Rider's "fey" (doomed) mood. It identifies Dernhelm as a tragic figure seeking an end to their "cage."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "surviving a charge."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "ghosts from Dimholt."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" using the term "psychic."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "looking for ale."

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The inclusion of the poem serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Transform the immediate military movement into a timeless, mythic event, contextualizing the ride as a final fulfillment of fate.**

**Why this is correct:**
The poem uses archaic language and mentions "songs tell us." It frames the current action as part of Rohan's legendary history. It elevates the "dusty" ride into a mythic "forth-riding," reinforcing the climax of the "heroic age."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "colorful diversions."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "maintaining secrets."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about the "Morning never returning."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "Thengel’s son as a poet."

### Question 10 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Dernhelm’s offer to bear Merry marks a moment of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A secretive, subversive alliance between marginalized characters who use their shared "unimportance" to bypass the logic of the Great.**

**Why this is correct:**
Both have been told they cannot go. By joining together, they form a "shadow" company. Their alliance is based on a mutual understanding of being "left behind" and a shared will to participate in the "renown" of the end.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "reckless disregard."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "good luck charms."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about "invisibility cloaks."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about the "King being too old to notice."
