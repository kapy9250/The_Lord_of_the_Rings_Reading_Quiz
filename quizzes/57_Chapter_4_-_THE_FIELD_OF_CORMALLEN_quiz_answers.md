### Question 1 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of the "huge shape of shadow... lighting-crowned" that rears above Mordor only to be "blown away" by a great wind symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total, ontological dissolution of Sauron's malicious "presence" and the end of his spiritual dominance over the physical world, characterized as a final, impotent gesture of defiance before his utter fading.**

**Why this is correct:**
The shape is "impenetrable" but "impotent." The "great wind" that blows it away is a classic Tolkien symbol for the intervention of the West (the Valar). It signifies that Sauron's power was a "Shadow"—real and terrifying, but ultimately derivative and ephemeral when confronted by the foundational light and order of the world. His "fading" is absolute and irreversible.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "terror," "enormous" scale, and a "hush" of awe. The description is intended to evoke the mythic significance of the Dark Lord's final end, rather than provide any humorous or domestic contrast.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s acceptance of "downfall" and his statement—"I am glad that you are here with me... Here at the end of all things"—reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A serene, stoic peace that has replaced his former "strain of will," where the completion of the task allows him to face the "end" with a purely relational joy, valuing companionship more than survival.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is "lost in ruin and downfall." He believes they will die. Yet, his voice is "himself again" and he feels "peace." This marks the final restoration of his character after the "madness" at the Crack. He has moved from the "burden" of the mission to the "blessedness" of his friendship with Sam, choosing to face his "doom" with a quiet, un-Shadowed heart.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Denethor surrendered to despair *before* his task was finished, Frodo’s state is one of *fulfillment* and "peace" *after* his task is achieved. His acceptance of death is not a failure of will but a serene recognition of reality.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s wish to hear their story told—"the story of Nine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom"—marks a shift in his perception of their journey from:**

**Correct Answer: B. A series of individual, agonizing moments of suffering to a unified, mythic narrative that will be preserved in the cultural memory of the world, providing a sense of "eternal" meaning to their personal sacrifice.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam explicitly compares their story to the "tale of Beren One-hand." He is now looking at their life as a "Chapter" in a larger book. This "mythic" perspective provides him with the comfort of historical continuity. It transforms their "filthy" and "parched" reality into an act of "renown," allowing him to endure the "end" with a sense of participating in something "worth a song."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Sam’s memory is described as "full" and "flooding back" earlier in the chapter. His interest in the "story" is a sign of his *increased* awareness of the meaning of his memories, rather than a loss of them.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction upon waking up in Ithilien—wondering "Is everything sad going to come untrue?"—indicates a state of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound, "Eucatastrophic" shock, where the sudden reversal of absolute despair into total, luminous joy makes the former "sadness" seem like an illusory or non-foundational layer of reality.**

**Why this is correct:**
This is the heart of Tolkien's concept of Eucatastrophe. Sam had accepted his own death. Waking up to Gandalf's laughter and "sunlight... green and gold" is so overwhelming that it challenges his understanding of grief. He is asking if the world itself has been reset to a state of unfallen goodness, where "joy" is the only ultimate truth.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he thought he was dead, the "sweet mingled scent" and the "twinkling of the leafy sunlight" are described as very physical and "earthly" sensations, leading him to realize he is back in "the land of Ithilien" rather than a spiritual after-world.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s instruction that they wear their "old and tattered clothes" to meet the King emphasizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The supreme, "High" honor of the Quest’s physical toll, where the scars and rags of service are recognized as the ultimate "livery" of nobility, transcending any conventional heraldry or finery.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf says "No silks and linens... could be more honourable." This reinforces the theme that true status is earned through "deeds" and "suffering" rather than inherited rank. By appearing in their "orc-rags," Frodo and Sam bring the physical truth of their victory into the "High" court of the King, validating the "un-Great" methods through which the war was actually won.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Gandalf's tone is one of "honour" and "preservation." He is treating the rags as sacred artifacts of the Quest, rather than expressing a personal cultural preference for the Shire's simplicity.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The Sindarin praise—"Daur a Berhael, Conin en Annun!" (Frodo and Sam, Princes of the West!)—and the blushing of the hobbits reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The comical but moving discrepancy between their "small," humble self-image and the vast, mythic "High" recognition they have earned, highlighting the theme of the "un-Great" achieving the greatest praise.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo and Sam see themselves as "little people" who just did their "job." Hearing thousands of warriors and Elf-lords praise them as "Ring-bearers" and "Princes" causes them to "blush." This reaction maintains their essential "hobbitness"—they remain humble and "amazed" even at the peak of their mythic recognition, illustrating the incorruptibility of their characters.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text explicitly states they were "surprised" and their "eyes shining with wonder." They do not claim the titles; the titles are "given" to them by the "Great" who recognize their supreme service.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s decision to bow his knee to the hobbits and set them upon the thrones signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. A radical, ritualistic inversion of the traditional hierarchy of power, where the returned "High" King publicly acknowledges that his own sovereign restoration was only made possible by the "Lower" but more foundational service of the small.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn is the "King of Gondor." His bowing to the hobbits is a supreme gesture of humility and "truth-speaking." He recognizes that while he fought the visible battles, they fought the internal and decisive one. By setting them on the thrones, he symbolically places the "Shire-folk" at the center of the world's new order, acknowledging his debt to their "darkest road."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The act is presented as a "High" and personal act of "final and complete satisfaction" for Aragorn and the hobbits, rather than a calculated piece of political propaganda or puppet-rule.

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The effect of the minstrel’s song on the host—where "hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords"—describes an aesthetic experience of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "High" catharsis, where the artistic transmutation of suffering into song creates a joy so intense and "piercing" that it reaches a state of spiritual transcendence, reconciling the "wounds" of the past with the "blessedness" of the present.**

**Why this is correct:**
The song makes them feel "pain and delight flow together." This is the ultimate "High" aesthetic moment in the book. The "wounds" are the memories of loss, but the "sweet words" turn that loss into a source of communal "wine." It highlights art's role in the "healing" of the world, providing a spiritual resolution to the "grim morn" of the war.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The "swords" metaphor is used to describe the *intensity* and *piercing* quality of the "joy" ("joy was like swords"), rather than to provide a humorous contrast to the noise of the actual battle.

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Legolas’s final song about the Sea and the "voices of my people" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Underscore the "High" tragedy of the Elves' victory—that their success in the war against Sauron has finalized the "fading" of their own world, making their departure into the West an inevitable and bittersweet conclusion to their time in Middle-earth.**

**Why this is correct:**
Legolas sings "For our days are ending and our years failing." The victory of Men (Aragorn’s return) means the "diminishing" of the Elves. Legolas’s "sea-longing" is his personal response to this historical necessity. His song provides a melancholic coda to the "glad day," reminding the reader that the "New Age" of Men comes at the price of the "Elder Race’s" final departure.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The song is a lament for "leaving the woods" and a longing for "Elvenhome that no man can discover." It is a song of *departure* and "failing," rather than a plan for invasion or continued conquest.

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s initial refusal of any sword, and his subsequent acceptance of Sam’s small blade, indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological "aftermath" of the Quest, where the Ring-bearer is permanently marked by his role as a sacrificial figure who "cannot strike any blow again," while maintaining his bond with Sam through the exchange of the smaller, domestic-scale weapon.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s refusal ("I do not wish for any sword") shows his complete dissociation from the martial world. He has carried the ultimate "weapon" and it has broken him. However, his acceptance of the "small sword that had belonged to Sam" is an act of friendship. It signifies that while he is done with "war," he is not done with "Sam," maintaining their unique bond through this shared, "lowly" token.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Frodo is "pale and worn" but his eyes have "peace now." His refusal is not a return to his "un-hardened" self, but a sign of his *transcendence* beyond the need for physical conflict after his spiritual "ordeal."
