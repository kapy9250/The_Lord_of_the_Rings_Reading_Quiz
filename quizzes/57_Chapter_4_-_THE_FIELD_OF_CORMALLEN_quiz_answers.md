### Question 1 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of the shadow reared above Mordor symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total dissolution of Sauron's malicious presence, characterized as a final, impotent gesture before his utter fading.**

**Why this is correct:**
The shape is "impenetrable" but "impotent." The "great wind" blows it away—a classic Tolkien symbol for the intervention of the West. It signifies that Sauron's power was a "Shadow," ultimately ephemeral when confronted by foundational order.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s statement reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A serene peace that has replaced his former strain, where completion allows him to face the end with purely relational joy.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo's voice is "himself again" and he feels "peace." This marks the restoration of his character after the "madness." He has moved from the "burden" to the "blessedness" of his friendship with Sam.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s wish marks a shift to:**

**Correct Answer: B. A unified, mythic narrative that will be preserved in cultural memory, providing eternal meaning to their sacrifice.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam compares their story to the "tale of Beren." He is looking at their life as a "Chapter" in a larger book. This mythic perspective transforms their filthy reality into an act of "renown."

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction indicates a state of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound, "Eucatastrophic" shock, where the sudden reversal of despair makes the former "sadness" seem like an illusory layer of reality.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam asking if everything sad is going to come untrue is the heart of Eucatastrophe. Waking up to laughter and sunlight challenges his understanding of grief, identifying joy as the only ultimate truth.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s instruction emphasizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The supreme honor of the Quest’s physical toll, where the rags of service are recognized as the ultimate "livery" of nobility.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf says "No silks and linens... could be more honourable." This reinforces that true status is earned through deeds. By appearing in "orc-rags," they bring the physical truth of victory into the High court.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The Sindarin praise and blushing reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The moving discrepancy between their humble self-image and the vast mythic recognition they have earned.**

**Why this is correct:**
Hearing thousands of warriors praise them as "Princes" causes them to "blush." This reaction maintains their "hobbitness"—they remain humble even at the peak of mythic recognition.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s decision signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. A radical, ritualistic inversion of hierarchy, acknowledging his restoration was only made possible by the service of the small.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn recognizes that while he fought visible battles, they fought the decisive one. By setting them on the thrones, he symbolically places the "Shire-folk" at the center of the world's new order.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The effect of the minstrel’s song describes:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "High" catharsis, where the transmutation of suffering into song reconciling the wounds of the past with the present.**

**Why this is correct:**
The song makes them feel "pain and delight flow together." The "wounds" are memories of loss, but the "sweet words" turn that loss into a source of communal wine.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s acceptance of Sam’s small blade indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological aftermath of the Quest, where the Bearer is marked by his role as a sacrificial figure who "cannot strike any blow again."**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s refusal of a sword shows his dissociation from the martial world. However, his acceptance of Sam's blade is an act of friendship, maintaining their bond through this lowly token.

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Legolas’s final song serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Underscore the tragedy of victory—that success has finalized the "fading" of the Elves' world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Legolas's "sea-longing" is his personal response to historical necessity. His song provides a melancholic coda, reminding the reader that the "New Age" of Men comes at the price of the Elder Race's departure.
