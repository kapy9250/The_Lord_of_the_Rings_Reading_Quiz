### Question 1 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s deduction that the horses did not sound like they were in "terror" but rather "wild with some sudden gladness" primarily indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. His developing intuition that the "old man" seen in the night may not have been the malevolent force they initially feared, but rather a restorative presence recognized by the natural world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Legolas notes the horses spoke as if they "meet a friend that they have long missed." Aragorn agrees, although he "cannot read the riddle." This observation challenges their initial assumption that the "old man" was Saruman. It shows the characters (and the reader) that nature and animals have a more direct perception of the returning Gandalf’s true nature, even when the "Three Hunters" are blinded by their own fear.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Shadowfax is the "chief of the Mearas" and is described as "run[ning] as smoothly as a swift stream." The horses' departure was an act of loyalty and recognition of their leader, not an escape from duty.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "riddle" of the hobbits' escape, as analyzed by Aragorn from the Golden leaf and the orc-knife, serves to characterize the hobbits as:**

**Correct Answer: B. Possessing a unique blend of physical smallness, unexpected resilience, and a grounded, domestic spirit that allows them to prioritize survival and nourishment even in the heart of a nightmare.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn notes that the hobbit "rested and ate a little before he crept away" and that having "lembas in his pocket... is like a hobbit." This highlights the core "hobbitness" that Gandalf values: their ability to maintain their basic identity and needs (food and rest) even in extreme peril. This resilience is what allowed them to escape the Orcs and survive the crossing of Rohan.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gimli jokingly asks about "sorcery," but Aragorn provides a purely practical and character-based explanation: use of the elven-cloak for concealment and the orc-knife for the bonds.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Legolas’s observation that Fangorn is "old, very old" and that it makes him "feel young again" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The profound Elven connection to deep time and the natural world, where the antiquity of the forest provides a comforting and familiar scale of existence that transcends the "tenseness" of the current war.**

**Why this is correct:**
Legolas is an immortal Elf, yet even he finds Fangorn "old." The fact that it makes him feel "young" illustrates the difference between Elven time and human/dwarf time. To an Elf, a forest that remembers the "Elder Days" is a connection to their own origins, providing a spiritual "home" that contrasts with the "musty and shabby" perception of the shorter-lived Gimli.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he calls his companions "children," the tone is one of wonder and comfort in the forest’s age, rather than an attempt to demean his friends. He is expressing his own aesthetic and spiritual experience.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s refusal to "shoot an old man so, at unawares and unchallenged" despite Gimli’s panic illustrates his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Adherence to a high moral and chivalric code that refuses to commit an act of "evil" (murdering an unidentified elder) even under the threat of sorcery, prioritizing character over immediate security.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli is terrified and wants to "shoot first." Aragorn, as the leader and the heir of Elendil, insists on moral law: "We may not shoot an old man so." This defines his kingship; he will not use the Enemy's methods (preemptive, unprovoked killing) even when his own life seems at risk. It proves his worthiness to be the "One" who resists the "Nine."

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn explicitly admits to "fear or doubt" and calls the situation a "peril." He doesn't think the man is "harmless"; he simply believes that his own moral integrity is more important than his safety.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the old man’s laugh—like the "sudden bite of a keen air, or the slap of a cold rain"—primarily conveys:**

**Correct Answer: B. A bracing, restorative, and bracingly honest power that shocks the system into a higher state of awareness, signaling a presence that is "wild" and powerful but fundamentally aligned with the truth.**

**Why this is correct:**
The simile of "keen air" and "cold rain" suggests something that "wakes an uneasy sleeper." This laugh is not cruel (like the Orcs') but "astounding" and "piercing." It represents the "White Rider's" new, celestial authority—a power that is beautiful but also "terrible" and "dangerous" because it is absolutely aligned with the primordial light of the world.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Aragorn explicitly feels "shudder" but "not fear or terror." The laugh is bracing and startling, but it does not carry the "hideous" or "foul" quality associated with the Enemy.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s comment that he is "Saruman as he should have been" suggests that his transformation into "The White" represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The reclamation and perfection of the office of "The White" (wisdom, leadership, and resistance) which Saruman vacated through treachery, now fully embodied by a resurrected and more powerful Gandalf.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf has been "sent back" to finish his task. By calling himself "white now" and "Saruman as he should have been," he signifies that he has inherited the authority and responsibility that Saruman betrayed. He is no longer just "the Grey" (the pilgrim); he is now the official leader of the resistance, possessing the clarity and power that the White Council's head was intended to have.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Gandalf’s new power is described as "wise and kindly" even though it is "perilous." He acknowledges his own potential for danger ("And so am I, very dangerous"), showing a self-awareness that is the opposite of Saruman's arrogant "shutters."

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s analysis of the Enemy’s "wisdom"—supposing the Company was going to Minas Tirith to use the Ring—highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The fundamental "blind spot" of evil, which is unable to comprehend selfless sacrifice or the voluntary destruction of power, allowing the "weak" to move unnoticed through his own lack of imagination.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf calls Sauron a "wise fool." Sauron’s "wisdom" is entirely based on the pursuit of power. Because he would never destroy the Ring, he cannot imagine that his enemies would. This psychological limitation is the Fellowship's only " surety of victory." It reinforces the theme that the "weak" (the hobbits) are the most effective against the "Great" because they operate outside the "Great's" moral logic.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While Sauron is "very wise" in the sense of power-calculation, Gandalf is pointing out his *failure* to perceive the true plan, making him a "fool" in the cosmic sense.

### Question 8 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s refusal to find the hobbits himself, telling Aragorn "the quest of your companions is over... You must go to Edoras," indicates a shift in focus from:**

**Correct Answer: A. A personal rescue mission to a larger, geopolitical responsibility where the "Three Hunters" must now act as the primary instruments of Gondor and Rohan’s defense.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf knows where the hobbits are (with Treebeard) and that they are safe. He now directs the "Three Hunters" toward their next duty: the "battle for which [Andúril] has so long waited." This marks the expansion of the story's scope. The "private" rescue of friends is superseded by the "public" defense of the West, beginning with the unmasking of the evil in Edoras.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gandalf has a very clear understanding of the situation. He knows the hobbits have "their own part to play" and that Aragorn's presence is required elsewhere to turn the tide of the larger war.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s account of his battle with the Balrog, specifically the "nameless things" that gnaw the world "far below the deepest delvings," serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Hint at a vast, primordial layer of horror and existence that predates even the current struggle between good and evil, expanding the cosmic scale of the world and the magnitude of Gandalf’s "fall" and "return."**

**Why this is correct:**
The "nameless things" are "older than [Sauron]." This detail adds a layer of "ancient world" mystery to the narrative. It shows that Gandalf's journey took him to the very "foundations of stone," a place of absolute, existential isolation. This makes his resurrection more "miraculous" and emphasizes his new, "White" status as one who has seen the "uttermost" depths and survived.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Sauron is still "mightier" than Gandalf the White in raw power. The "nameless things" are an *additional* layer of world-building, not a direct critique of Sauron's own relative power in the current age.

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The message Galadriel sends to Aragorn ("Near is the hour when the Lost should come forth... The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea") functions as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A cryptic, prophetic directive that identifies Aragorn’s unique and "dark" path toward kingship, requiring him to confront the forgotten or "lost" elements of his own kingdom’s history to achieve victory.**

**Why this is correct:**
Galadriel’s message points Aragorn toward the "Paths of the Dead" (which will be a major plot point later). It challenges him to seek out his "kinsfolk" and the "Grey Company." This reinforces his identity as the "Elessar" who must walk a "dark road" to find the "light" of his kingdom. It frames his future actions as a fulfillment of ancient, "foretold" necessity.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The message is about the *road* to the Sea, which is watched by the "Dead." It is a directive to *confront* this path, not to avoid it.
