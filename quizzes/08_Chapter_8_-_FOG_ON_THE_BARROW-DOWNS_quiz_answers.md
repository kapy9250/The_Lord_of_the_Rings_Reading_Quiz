### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "sweet singing" Frodo hears in his mind at the beginning of the chapter, which reveals a "far green country" under a "swift sunrise," most likely represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A spiritual vision of the Undying Lands, providing a glimpse of ultimate hope and rest that transcends his current "grey rain-curtain" of fear.**

**Why this is correct:**
This vision (which recurs at the end of the entire story) is a sign of Frodo’s spiritual connection to the West. The "grey rain-curtain" and "silver" imagery suggest a transition from the physical world to a higher, more hopeful reality. It serves as a counterpoint to the "dead night" and the "Barrow-wight" dreams, providing a core of hope that sustains him.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The vision is described as "sweet" and "growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver." This is associated with Tom and Goldberry’s influence and the "clear, bright" morning, rather than the "cold" and "dreary" nature of the Wight’s magic.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The view from the hill-top, described as "far-seen" and revealing the "guess of blue" that represents the distant mountains, serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Expand the narrative scope from the domestic and local to the epic and continental, aligning the hobbits' journey with the wider world's history.**

**Why this is correct:**
The passage links the "guess of blue" to "memory and old tales, of the high and distant mountains." This moves the story away from the "wooded ridges" of the Shire and toward the epic geography of Middle-earth. It signals that the hobbits are no longer just "walking over the Shire" but are now part of a continental quest.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The hobbits are described as taking a "deep draught of the air" and feeling "lusty as Tom." The view inspires them with a sense of possibility and energy, rather than discouragement.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "single stone" in the center of the saucer-like hill, which cast "no shadow" at noon and was "cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it," functions as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A symbol of the unnatural, ancient power residing in the Downs that remains indifferent and resistant to the life-giving force of the sun.**

**Why this is correct:**
The sun is at its zenith ("fearless noon"), yet it cannot warm the stone. This "unnatural" quality marks the stone as part of the Wight’s domain—a place where the warmth and light of the world are nullified. It is a "warning" that the hobbits ignore, leading to their "sleep they had never meant to take."

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The stone is described as "shapeless and yet significant... like a warning." Tom later advises them to "pass barrows by" and "don't go a-meddling with old stone." Tom is a protector, but the stone itself is a remnant of the "shadow" that came "out of dark places."

### Question 4 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The transformation of the fog into a "hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone" creates a psychological effect of:**

**Correct Answer: B. Claustrophobia and entrapment, suggesting that the environment itself has become a sentient, architectural prison.**

**Why this is correct:**
The fog doesn't just surround them; it "mounts," "bends over their heads," and becomes a "roof." This architectural language ("hall," "pillar," "roof") suggests a deliberate, constructed trap. It turns the open hills into a confined, threatening interior space, mirroring the literal barrow they will soon be trapped in.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The hobbits feel "as if a trap was closing about them" and "in dismay." The fog is not perceived as a protection, but as a predator.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s sudden fall from his pony and the subsequent disappearance of his friends after passing between the "two huge standing stones" imply that:**

**Correct Answer: B. The stones acted as a gateway or a "trap-door" into a different, darker layer of reality controlled by the Wights.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo sees the stones as a "headless door" and "darkness seemed to fall round him" the moment he passes between them. The fact that he is suddenly alone, despite the others being right behind him in a "file," suggests a supernatural abduction or a shifting of space. The stones are the threshold of the Wight’s "house."

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
They were in a "file," which is specifically intended to "prevent their getting separated." A mere difference in speed wouldn't explain why they "had not followed him" and why the "darkness fell" so suddenly.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**What does Frodo’s thought of putting on the Ring to escape the barrow, while leaving his friends behind, reveal about the Ring’s influence at that moment?**

**Correct Answer: B. The Ring is attempting to sever his moral and social ties, exploiting his fear to encourage a selfish, isolated survival that would ultimately lead to his corruption.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "wild thought of escape" is framed as a "logical" rationalization (Gandalf would understand). This is the Ring's classic mode of operation: it offers "safety" through isolation and the abandonment of others. By focusing only on his own "freedom," Frodo would be taking the first step toward becoming a "shadow" like the Wights.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
This is Frodo’s internal *rationalization* of his fear, but the narrative later clarifies that the "courage that had been awakened in him" was the true path, implying that Gandalf would *not* have approved of abandoning his friends.

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to hew at the "crawling arm" instead of putting on the Ring marks a turning point in his character development because:**

**Correct Answer: B. It represents a conscious rejection of the "easy" but corrupting path of the Ring in favor of a difficult, self-sacrificial loyalty.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo "wavered" and "fought with himself" before "resolve hardened." He chooses to stay in the dark, trapped barrow to fight for his friends rather than using the Ring to run "free over the grass." This is his first major "victory" over the Ring’s psychological temptation and proves his moral worthiness as the Ring-bearer.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The physical act of hewing is less important than the *moral decision* that preceded it. His "resolve" is what matters, not his "skill," especially since the sword splinters immediately.

### Question 8 `[PIS/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s confused memory upon waking—"The men of Carn Dum came on us at night... the spear in my heart!"—suggests that:**

**Correct Answer: B. The Barrow-wight’s spell involved a form of psychic possession, forcing the victim to relive the traumatic final moments of the ancient person buried in the mound.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry’s memory is of being "worsted" by the men of Carn Dum, which Tom later identifies as the enemy of the people who were buried there. This indicates that the Wight’s magic blurs the boundary between the living and the dead, making the hobbits "occupy" the history of the treasures they were dressed in. It’s a literalizing of the "cold rags" and "thin white rags" they were wearing.

**Why E is incorrect** `[CC]`:
Tom told them the history *after* they woke up and were safe. Merry’s initial exclamation happens *before* Tom’s explanation, proving the memory came from his experience *inside* the barrow.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Tom Bombadil’s choice of the "brooch set with blue stones" for Goldberry and his remark about the woman who "long ago wore this" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Provide a bridge of memory and respect between the living present and the tragic, "forgotten" past, reclaiming a small piece of beauty from the shadow.**

**Why this is correct:**
By taking the brooch and saying "we will not forget her," Tom performs an act of commemoration. He takes an object associated with death and "shadow" and returns it to the world of light and joy (Goldberry). It shows that the history of the "forgotten kings" still has value and that beauty can be redeemed from the grave.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Tom speaks of the original owner in the past tense ("Fair was she who long ago wore this"). Goldberry is the "River-daughter," an elemental being, and there is no indication she is a ghost or reincarnation.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "vision" the hobbits have of "tall and grim" men and the "star on his brow" as Tom speaks of the daggers primarily functions to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Contextualize the hobbits' small journey within a vast, heroic historical narrative, indicating that they are now part of a long-standing resistance against the Shadow.**

**Why this is correct:**
The vision of the "Men of Westernesse" and the "star on his brow" (Aragorn/the Dúnedain) connects the hobbits' immediate fear to a 3,000-year-old struggle. It dignifies their "adventure" by showing them the lineage of the daggers they now carry. They are no longer just hobbits lost in the woods; they are now armed with the "serpent-forms" of a fallen but noble kingdom.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The vision is of "Men, tall and grim," distinct from the "hobbit-people" whom Tom says are "long enough" to use the daggers as swords. The vision emphasizes the scale of the world *outside* the Shire, not a physical transformation of the hobbits themselves.
