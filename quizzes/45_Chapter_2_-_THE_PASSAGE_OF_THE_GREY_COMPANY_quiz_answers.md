### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s decision to offer his sword to Théoden reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound psychological need to transition from a passive, protected "child" role to an active, recognized participant in the heroic narrative.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry feels "unneeded baggage." His act of fealty is a way to reclaim his identity and agency. He transforms his status from a victim/passenger to a "sworn esquire," grounding himself in a heroic tradition that provides him with a purpose in the "High" world.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "tactical council."

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The arrival of the "Grey Company" marks a shift toward:**

**Correct Answer: B. The spontaneous, spiritual "answering" of the world to Aragorn’s internal needs, signaling the start of his transition from solitary Ranger to a sovereign leader.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn did not summon them "save only in wish." Their arrival reflects the theme of "providence." It provides him with his own "kindred" following, marking the first time he leads a group of his own people, moving toward his role as King.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "democratic."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "replacing Men."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "North being conquered."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "filler."

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s startling physical change indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The staggering psychological and spiritual cost of his "will-combat" with Sauron, where his victory was won through an exhaustive expenditure of his own vital essence.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn has wrestled with the Dark Lord through the Stone. This is a battle of will and "lore." His "grey-hued" and "weary" face is the physical price of asserting his royal "Right" over the Stone's Master.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Lore-Trap" about "magical de-aging."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Black Breath relapse."
- **D** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "draining blood."
- **E** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "resentment toward Gandalf."

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s use of the Palantír is intended to:**

**Correct Answer: A. Provoke a reckless and "hasty" response from the Enemy by introducing a new, ancient fear, thereby creating a distraction for the Ring-bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn says "the hasty stroke goes oft astray." By showing the "blade re-forged," he forces Sauron to focus on Gondor. This tactical distraction is intended to help Frodo's "unseen" journey by drawing the Eye's attention elsewhere.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **B** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "one-on-one fights."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "possessing the Ring."
- **D** is a "Half-Truth" about "securing loyalty."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "signaling the Dead."

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Éowyn’s primary fear is:**

**Correct Answer: B. The existential suffocation of a heroic spirit trapped within restrictive social and gender roles, where "duty" is experienced as a prison of powerlessness.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éowyn explicitly calls her fear "a cage." She feels trapped by the requirement to stay behind while others win "renown." Her "torment" is the conflict between her noble identity and her individual desire for a heroic destiny.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "physical beauty."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "interest in Gondor."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects her of "suspecting Aragorn."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about the "physical size of the Hall."

### Question 6 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "mighty stone" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Visually and symbolically mark the threshold into a "liminal" space where the normal laws of the living are suspended.**

**Why this is correct:**
The stone is "threatening" and causing "dread." Narratively, it marks the transition to the "Paths of the Dead." It is a sentinel of the "Accursed Years," signaling that the Company is entering a space beyond mortal logic.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "literal clocks."
- **C** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "Finger-worshipers."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "landscape as an ally."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "milestones."

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s reaction illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The intense, spiritual "dread" that even a grounded Dwarf feels when entering a realm defined by broken oaths and un-living malice.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli is "wroth with himself." His fear challenges his identity as a "hard" Dwarf. The "blindness" and "lead" feet are manifestations of a spiritual crisis—encountering a "Shadow" his nature cannot master.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "lack of oxygen."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "thinning."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "gravity-magic."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "relationship to Oathbreakers."

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The discovery of the "bones" serves as a:**

**Correct Answer: B. Gruesome and final reminder of the futility of individual physical struggle against the spiritual weight of the "Accursed Years."**

**Why this is correct:**
The "finger-bones... still clawing" summarize the tragedy. Even the "mighty" cannot open this way by force. It sets the stage for Aragorn’s success—he opens the way by royal authority rather than by "hewing."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Comedy" distractor about "tourist destinations."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Orc pantries."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "lock-picking."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "larger ancient Kings."

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s authority is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme, ontological authority that bridges life and death, offering the only possible "peace" to a people bound by a mythic curse.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn offers "peace" in exchange for the "fulfillment of the oath." He is providing the legal and spiritual conclusion to their suffering. This is an act of sovereign judgment, marking his highest "White" authority.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "promise of loot."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects "necromancy."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about "disciplined Rangers."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "distrusting Men of Gondor."

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The final image of the Company signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The transition of the narrative into a mythic dimension, where the "West" operates beyond the perception and logic of the mundane world.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Company is "lost to mortal sight." They move into a "darkness" where there is "no dawn." This suggests Aragorn has entered a legendary space, leading a supernatural force through the "Storm."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "magical shrinking."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "being killed."
- **D** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "author losing interest."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "seeing in the dark."
