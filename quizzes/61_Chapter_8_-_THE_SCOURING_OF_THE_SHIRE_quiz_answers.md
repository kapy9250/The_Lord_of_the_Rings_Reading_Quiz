### Question 1 `[SCA/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The new houses at the Brandywine Bridge—described as "two-storeyed with narrow straight-sided windows... gloomy and un-Shirelike"—symbolize:**

**Correct Answer: B. The architectural and psychological "Mordorization" of the Shire, where the organic and hospitable traditions of hobbit-holes are replaced by a sterile, utilitarian, and authoritarian aesthetic.**

**Why this is correct:**
The new buildings are described as "bare and dimly lit" and "ugly." They stand in stark contrast to the comfortable, round-windowed hobbit-holes that define the Shire's character. This architectural shift mirrors the political shift: the Shire is no longer a place of "peace and content" but has been colonized by Saruman’s "mind of metal and wheels," turning its domestic spaces into "gloomy" guard-houses.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Bree has tall houses, the text emphasizes the "un-Shirelike" and "mean" quality of these new buildings, characterizing them as a specific, invasive corruption rather than a natural cultural borrowing.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction to the "Notice" on the gate—threatening to "tear down your notice when I find it"—reveals a character that is now:**

**Correct Answer: B. Fully liberated from the "un-important" social constraints of his former life, possessing a hardened and decisive self-confidence that refuses to accept the "small" bullying of a corrupted local authority.**

**Why this is correct:**
In Book 1, Sam was a respectful, even subservient, gardener. After facing Shelob and the Crack of Doom, the "Rules" of the Chief seem ridiculous to him. He uses "light words" but with a "masterful" tone. His refusal to be kept out in the wet is an assertion of his new, "High" identity as a hero who recognizes that the Chief's authority is a sham.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Sam’s anger is a "High" moral indignation at the violation of his homeland's traditions, rather than a slide into the "foul" or "robber-like" nature of the ruffians. He is fighting *for* the Shire's former kindness.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the "gatherers" and "sharers" who do "more gathering than sharing" characterizes Lotho’s regime as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A parasitic and extractive bureaucracy that uses the rhetoric of communal "sharing" to mask a system of state-sponsored theft and the centralization of resources for the benefit of the "Chief" and his Men.**

**Why this is correct:**
Farmer Cotton explains that they "don't rightly know what becomes of it." The "gathering" is for "storage" that the hobbits "never see." This is a classic critique of a corrupt, centralized economy. Lotho uses the language of "fair distribution" to justify robbing his neighbors, effectively turning the Shire into a plantation for his own (and Saruman's) profit.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text notes that there was a "fine summer and harvest," proving there was no natural need for such extreme "storage." The scarcity is artificial, created by the regime's extractive policies.

### Question 4 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s insistence that "no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose... and it is not to begin now" establishes his leadership as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "Higher" moral guardianship that seeks to preserve the fundamental, ethical sanctity of the Shire’s communal identity even while fighting to liberate it, refusing to use the Enemy’s methods of fratricide.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo recognizes that the true victory is not just removing the ruffians, but ensuring the Shire's soul remains "un-Shadowed." By forbidding the slaying of hobbits who have "gone over," he prevents the war from turning into a permanent, internal blood-feud. He acts as the "spiritual conscience" of the rebellion, maintaining the Shire’s highest tradition of peace even in the midst of battle.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Frodo is not refusing to fight; he allows Merry to make the "arrangements" and raise the Shire. He is setting *moral limits* on that fight to ensure its long-term success as a restoration rather than just a revenge.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s decision to blow the "horn of Rohan" and the "Horn-cry of Buckland" serves narratively to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Synchronize the "Low" local tradition of the Shire with the "High" martial culture of Rohan, using the mythic authority of the Horn to shatter the hobbits' domestic paralysis and spark a collective, elemental uprising.**

**Why this is correct:**
The horn-call is described as "compelling" and "shaking the air." It is a sound "they have never heard before." By using the gift of Éowyn, Merry brings the "High" world's heroic energy into the "Low" world of the Shire. This acts as a catalyst, waking the "sturdy hobbitry" from their habit of "getting under cover" and turning them into an army of "hunters."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text specifies that it is the *Shire-folk themselves* who answer the call ("dogs barked; feet came running," "Bywater is up!"). The horn is used to raise the *local* population, not to summon external reinforcements.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Rosie Cotton’s response to Sam—"you haven't hurried, have you?" and then "I think you look fine, Sam"—characterizes her relationship with him as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A mixture of traditional Shire "teasing" and a deep, intuitive recognition of his new, heroic stature, using domestic irony to ground their reunion while affirming her pride in his transformation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Rosie’s first words are a "jest"—accusing him of not hurrying when he has been saving the world. This is typical Shire-humor. But her subsequent comment ("you look fine, Sam") and her "shining eyes" show she recognizes the "High" change in him (his armor and his "masterful" presence). She accepts him back into her "domestic" world while acknowledging his "Great" deeds.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While she mentions Frodo, her focus is on her "expecting [Sam] since the spring," and her final encouragement is specifically for Sam to "take care of yourself," showing her primary emotional bond is with him.

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The replacement of the Hobbiton mill with a "bigger one... full o' wheels and outlandish contraptions" that pours out "filth a purpose" represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The "wanton" and non-productive nature of Saruman’s technological evil, where the goal is not "gristing corn" but the deliberate destruction of the natural environment and the industrial enslavement of the local population.**

**Why this is correct:**
Farmer Cotton notes that "they don't grind no more corn at all." The new mill is purely destructive—it produces only "smoke and a stench" and "filth." This is the ultimate "High" critique of Saruman's "industry": it is not a tool for prosperity, but a weapon of environmental and social degradation, intended to turn the "fat little country" into a "desert."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Cotton points out that "there was no more for the new mill to do than for the old," proving the expansion was not based on any rational need but on Saruman's desire for "power and wheels."

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s pity for Saruman and his refusal to let him be slain ("It is useless to meet revenge with revenge: it will heal nothing") reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total "transcendence" of the Ring-bearer, who has moved beyond the logic of vengeance and power, recognizing that the true healing of the Shire requires a radical act of mercy that the wizard himself cannot comprehend.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman has ruined Frodo's home and tried to kill him. Yet, Frodo says "I would still spare him." This is the final proof of Frodo's "High" moral victory. He refuses to let Saruman’s "bitterness" infect his own heart. His mercy is "cruel" to Saruman because the wizard cannot stand to be "in debt" to someone he considers an "urchin."

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Frodo explicitly acknowledges Saruman's remaining power ("his voice that can still daunt you"). He isn't underestimating the danger; he is making a *moral choice* to reject the cycle of violence, even when the risk is known.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "pale shrouded figure" that rises from Saruman’s body and is "bent away" by a cold wind from the West signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The final, spiritual "rejection" of the fallen wizard by the Higher Powers (the Valar), where his soul is denied entry into the West and is literally blown away into the "nothingness" he chose.**

**Why this is correct:**
This scene mirrors the end of Sauron. The figure "looks to the West," seeking its former home. But the "cold wind" from the West (the Valar) rejects it. Saruman, like Sauron, is now a "pale shadow" who has lost his physical form and his place in the moral order of the world. He "dissolves into nothing," marking the absolute end of his "Cunning Mind."

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The tone is one of "horror," "pity," and "dismay," focusing on the spiritual finality of the wizard's fall rather than any humorous intent.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s final comment—"I shan't call it the end, till we've cleared up the mess"—characterizes his heroism as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A return to his foundational identity as a "laborer" and a "gardener," identifying the true completion of the Quest not as the death of a villain, but as the active, physical restoration of the world’s health and beauty.**

**Why this is correct:**
While Frodo sees the "end of the War," Sam sees the "work" ahead. For Sam, "victory" is not an abstract political state but a practical, biological one: replanting trees and cleaning up the "filth." This reflects his "sturdy" and productive nature. He accepts that being a hero in the war was just a "job of work" that must now be followed by the "real" job of healing the earth.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Sam is being "gloomy" about the *amount of work* required ("take a lot of time and work"), rather than suggesting that the military conflict itself is ongoing. He is focused on the *physical cleanup* of the Shire.
