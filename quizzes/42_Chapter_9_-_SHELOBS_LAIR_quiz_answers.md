### Question 1 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the darkness in Shelob's Lair as a "black vapour wrought of veritable darkness" that brings "blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind" characterizes the tunnel as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A place of ontological negation, where the environment is not just an absence of light but an active, psychological contaminant that erases the victim's internal connection to the "Seen" world.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text emphasizes that the darkness was "deeper and denser" than Moria. It was a "black vapour" that "sound fell dead" in. This characterizes the lair as a realm of absolute nothingness—a spiritual vacuum that attacks the "mind" and the "memory." It is the physical manifestation of Ungoliant's legacy: a darkness that consumes light rather than just excluding it.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The tone is one of intense physical and spiritual oppression ("breathlessness," "stench," " blindness to the mind"), the opposite of humorous.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s memory of Galadriel and the subsequent "light in his mind" during the moment of total darkness suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological resilience of "High" Elven influence, where the memory of beauty and friendship acts as a spiritual emergency-light that can survive and ignite even in the heart of absolute despair.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam is standing in "blackness of despair and anger." The "light in his mind" is triggered by his internal vision of Galadriel. This illustrates how the "moral light" of his Shire-loyalties and Elven-friendships provides him with a reservoir of hope that external darkness cannot touch. It is his spiritual preparedness that allows him to remember the "Phial" when Frodo has forgotten it.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text says "it seemed to him that he saw a light," and he hears her voice "remote but clear." This is presented as an internal, psychological recollection of her *recorded* words and gifts, rather than an active, real-time telepathic intervention.

### Question 3 `[ACN/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The comparison of the Phial’s light to "Earendil had himself come down... with the last Silmaril upon his brow" elevates the conflict to:**

**Correct Answer: B. A direct, mythic confrontation between the highest light of the ancient world and the primal darkness of the abyss, contextualizing the hobbits' struggle within the epic history of the Silmarils.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Phial contains the light of Eärendil’s star, which is the light of a Silmaril. By using this comparison, the author links the "small" hobbits to the "Great" heroes of the First Age. It dignifies their struggle and shows that the "Ancient Light" is the only thing that can challenge Shelob, who is herself a remnant of the "Dark Years."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The Phial contains the *light* of the Silmaril (reflected in the water), not the physical jewel itself. The comparison is one of mythic quality and origin rather than a literal identification of the object.

### Question 4 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to walk "steadily down to meet the eyes" with Sting advanced primarily reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The transformation of his character into a proactive, mythic hero who uses the "deadly brightness" of his own moral clarity and the Elven-light to repel a primal evil that has never been challenged in its own lair.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo stops running and "gather[s] his courage." His steady walk toward the eyes is a supreme act of will. He is no longer a victim; he is the "Hobbit of the Shire" using Elven weapons to reclaim the space for light. This moment marks the peak of Frodo’s active heroism in Book 4, showing his internal "flame" is strong enough to daunt even Shelob.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text notes his "despair" and "terror." His courage is not a lack of fear, but the ability to act *despite* it, for the sake of the mission and his companion.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Shelob’s nature as a being that "served none but herself" and whose "vomit [was] darkness" characterizes her evil as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A purely nihilistic and self-consuming appetite that exists outside of any moral or political structure, representing a chaotic, "ancient" malice that even Sauron cannot fully command.**

**Why this is correct:**
Shelob is "last child of Ungoliant." She cares nothing for "towers or rings." Her evil is purely biological and gluttonous ("glut of life"). This differentiates her from Sauron’s "ordered" and political evil. She represents the "wild" darkness of the void, a primal force that consumes everything and produces only "vomit darkness," emphasizing her role as an ancient, un-governed predator.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text says Sauron "could spare" the Orcs she ate and that he views her as his "cat." While she is ancient and strong, she is currently localized and "hungry," existing as a useful but distinct element of Sauron’s broader system of control.

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s internal thought—"when She throws away the bones... we shall find it, we shall get it"—reveals his betrayal to be:**

**Correct Answer: B. A secondary, parasitic treachery that uses the "primal" evil of Shelob as a tool to bypass his own "fear of cold iron" and reclaim the Ring from the remains of his "nice Master."**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum is too afraid of "Master" and "Sting" to take the Ring by force. He uses Shelob as his "executioner." His plan is to scavenge the "Precious" from the "bones" Shelob leaves behind. This shows the cowardly and opportunistic nature of his malice—he facilitates a murder he is too weak to commit himself, hoping to profit from the "Darkness" of others.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gollum knows Shelob "only desired death for all others" and "mind and body." He hopes to hide his own plan from her ("inner chamber of his cunning"), indicating he knows she is not his ally but an indifferent force he is trying to exploit.

### Question 7 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "vast web" that blocks the tunnel’s end, which "gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowstring," symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The suffocating, "impervious" nature of Shelob’s entrapment, where conventional weapons and strength are neutralized by a resilient and ancient malice that absorbs opposition.**

**Why this is correct:**
The web is "denser-woven and far greater" than any normal web. Sam's "fury" and "force" are "tossed up" by the thread. This symbolizes the futility of brute strength against Shelob’s craft. The web is a physical manifestation of her "orderly" and "undefeated" hatred, requiring a specific, mythic weapon (Sting) to break it.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The tone is one of "bitterness," "despair," and "pain" (Sam's lashed hand). The description emphasizes the supernatural strength and "horror" of the obstacle.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "wild joy" and his feeling that his head "whirled as with a draught of potent wine" upon breaking the web indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A dangerous, "fey" intoxication of hope that leads to a momentary loss of caution, leaving him vulnerable to Shelob’s "many exits" and the relentless nature of her pursuit.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s joy is described as "whirling" and "wild." He shouts "high and wild," ignoring his own "habit of secrecy." This "fey" (doomed/manic) mood is a classic literary sign of impending tragedy. By running "heedlessly" toward the pass, Frodo believes the danger is over, failing to account for the "craft of Shelob" and her "many exits."

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While Frodo *feels* the errand is almost accomplished, the narrator’s subsequent warning ("Too little did he or his master know...") makes it clear that this belief is a tragic error of judgment.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s "spiteful" error—speaking and gloating before he had both hands on Sam’s neck—demonstrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The self-defeating nature of individual malice, where the desire for "pleasure" in the victim's suffering creates a tactical delay that allows the "sturdy" and loyal spirit to prevail.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum's "spite" made him speak ("Got him! ... you nassty filthy little sneak!"). This moment of gloating gave Sam the second he needed to "twist more quickly." This illustrates a recurring theme: evil is often undone by its own "need" for cruelty or its own "shrunken" and petty focus, whereas Sam's singular, "unthinking" devotion to his master provides him with "sudden violence and strength."

**Why C is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text attributes Sam's victory to his "fury at the treachery" and his "whole force," rather than a superior intelligence. It is a victory of character and "sturdy" physical resolve.

---

### Question 10 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The final image of Sam rushing "wildly up the path" and being "too late" marks a narrative transition from:**

**Correct Answer: B. A moment of focused, individual victory (Sam over Gollum) to a catastrophic, collective failure, leaving the "servant" in a state of absolute isolation and the Quest in its darkest hour.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam has just won a fight, but he "forgot everything else but the red fury." This momentary lapse in his primary duty (guarding Frodo) results in the "too late" realization. The chapter ends with Sam calling "wildly" into the darkness, emphasizing his total loneliness and the collapse of the "Fellowship of Two" at the very threshold of Mordor.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
This is the climax of Book 4, but there are still two more books to follow. The "success" of Gollum's plot is a major setback, but not the end of the entire story.
