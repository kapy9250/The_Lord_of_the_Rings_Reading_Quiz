### Question 1 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The scene at Crickhollow, specifically the "soft sound of horses led with stealth" and the "thin and menacing" voice of the Rider, serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Contrast the Shire’s internal "Horn-call" with the external, absolute authority of "Mordor," highlighting the vulnerability of the hobbits' civilization.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Rider's demand, "Open, in the name of Mordor!", is the first time that name is used as an overt political authority within the Shire's borders. The "FEAR! FIRE! FOES!" call of the hobbits is an ancient, communal alarm, but the ease with which the Riders "rode down the guards" shows that the hobbits' traditional defenses are woefully inadequate against the scale of the threat now facing them.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text says "Let the little people blow! Sauron would deal with them later." This indicates the Riders are completely indifferent to the hobbits' alarm, rather than afraid of it.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s comment that "Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen" and his decision to walk "in any case" primarily reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. His strategic expertise, which values stealth, terrain navigation, and concealment over raw speed on open roads where they would be easily visible.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider is a Ranger, and his strength lies in the "paths that are seldom trodden." He knows that on the Road, horses are faster, but in the wild, foot travel allows for "turning and doubling" and taking "cover." His plan is built on making the hobbits invisible to the enemy rather than trying to outrun them in a direct pursuit.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he is suspicious of Ferny, the decision to walk is presented as a fundamental part of his survival strategy ("I was going to walk in any case"), based on the reality of Eriador's geography and the nature of the enemy.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**What does the "buzzing" excitement of the Bree-landers during the hobbits' departure suggest about their understanding of the events?**

**Correct Answer: B. They perceive the terrifying reality of the quest as mere sensationalist entertainment, trivializing the hobbits' peril into local "news" and gossip.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that the events "made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years." The Bree-landers are "crowded in the road to see the travellers start" as if it were a parade. This highlights the gap between the "Outsiders" who are living through a mortal struggle and the local population who views it as a curious, "buzzing" distraction from their everyday lives.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Most Bree-landers do not understand the Ring or Sauron; they are focused on the "vanishing trick" and the "robbing of the stables," which are exciting but relatively small-scale events to them.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s action of hitting Bill Ferny with an apple and then regretfully saying "Waste of a good apple" indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A combination of fierce, protective loyalty and a pragmatic, Shire-born hospitality where physical food is still more "precious" than a successful act of defiance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam's reflex to hit Bill Ferny is a sign of his growing confidence and his defense of his master and "his" pony. However, his regret ("Waste of a good apple") shows that even in a moment of triumph, Sam remains grounded in the Shire's values: he values the apple as a good piece of fruit more than the satisfaction of wounding an enemy. This provides a moment of character depth and humor.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Sam is not becoming "foul"; he is reacting to a specific provocation from a known "wretch." His regret about the apple proves he still has his "hobbit-sense."

### Question 5 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s wandering course through the Chetwood ("many turns and doublings") serves as a metaphor for:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological necessity of "losing" one's old self and predictable patterns to survive in a world where the enemy knows your destination.**

**Why this is correct:**
By taking a "wandering course," Strider is teaching the hobbits that survival in the Wild requires them to abandon the "straight line" and the "predictable path." They are "cutting off a great loop" of their old lives. The "turns and doublings" reflect the shift from the Shire's linear safety to the Ranger's multi-layered and evasive existence.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Strider is explicitly "confident" and knows the land; the wandering is a deliberate tactic ("to put off any pursuit"), not a sign of confusion.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "white flashes" in the eastern sky and Strider’s reaction—standing "silent and watchful"—implies:**

**Correct Answer: B. A recognition of epic-scale conflict (likely Gandalf) that Strider perceives but cannot yet explain to the hobbits without increasing their fear.**

**Why this is correct:**
Strider says it is "too distant to make out," but the fact that he stands "silent and watchful" for a "long while" suggests he understands the flashes are significant and likely represent a battle of wills or powers (Gandalf at Weathertop). His silence protects the hobbits from the full weight of his anxiety while confirming his role as their watchful guardian.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Strider specifically says "It is not the dawn... It is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops," and he remains watchful long after a storm would have been identified. The "lightning" is clearly supernatural.

### Question 7 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Strider’s quick and "earnest" interruption of Frodo’s joke about becoming a "wraith" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. His acute awareness of the literal, terrifying reality of "wraithing" and the proximity of that danger to the Ring-bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo treats "becoming a wraith" as a joke about his weight loss. Strider, knowing the history of the Nine and the power of the Ring, understands that "wraithing" is the actual, spiritual fate awaiting Frodo if he continues to use the Ring. His "surprising earnestness" is a sign of his deep concern and his realization that Frodo is still too innocent to understand the true nature of the threat.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While names have power in Middle-earth, Strider's reaction is to the *idea* of the fate itself, and his desire to keep Frodo's mind focused on the light rather than the "thinning process" of the Shadow.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s recitation of *The Fall of Gil-galad* and his subsequent "blushing" suggests that:**

**Correct Answer: B. Sam’s internal character is much deeper and more aesthetically sensitive than his "rustic" exterior suggests, having been enriched by Bilbo’s tutelage.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "amazement" of the others and Sam's "blushing" show that this is a side of him he usually keeps hidden. The fact that he knows a "lay... in an ancient tongue" (even if in translation) reveals that Sam is a "scholar" in his own way, and that his devotion to Bilbo went beyond gardening to an appreciation of the mythic and the poetic.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
He isn't "ashamed" of the knowledge itself, but rather embarrassed by the sudden attention and the revelation of his own "book-learned" side to his friends.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The narrative shift during Strider’s telling of the tale of *Tinúviel*—where the "dark seems to press round so close" before the song—functions to:**

**Correct Answer: A. Provide a temporary "light" of mythic beauty to counteract the encroaching, physical darkness and fear of the Riders.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam begs for a tale of Elves because "the dark seems to press round so close." Strider’s chant of the *ann-thennath* provides a "fair tale" that "lifts up their hearts." Narratively, this provides a tonal counter-point to the horror of the Riders, showing that the world still contains "Starlight" and "silver" even when surrounded by the Shadow.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While the story is central to Tolkien's legendarium, its *narrative function* in this specific chapter is to provide psychological comfort and a sense of historical continuity for the hobbits during a moment of extreme fear.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to put on the Ring in the dell, despite knowing the "message of Gandalf," is described as a "temptation" that he "longed to yield" to. This indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The Ring’s escalating psychological dominance, which uses extreme terror to bypass the bearer's reason and force a "revelation" to the Wraiths.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s desire is "not with the hope of escape... he simply felt that he must take the Ring." This shows that the Ring is working in concert with the terror of the Riders to force Frodo into its domain. The Ring doesn't offer a solution; it demands submission. By yielding, Frodo makes himself "terribly clear" to the Wraiths, proving that the Ring’s "safety" is a trap designed to expose him.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text explicitly states his desire was *not* for escape or any practical reason, but a primal, irresistible compulsion to yield to the Ring’s influence.
