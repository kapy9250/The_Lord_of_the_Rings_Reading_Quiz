### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s choice to save Faramir illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "Higher" moral economy where the prevention of a spiritual and familial atrocity takes precedence over immediate military utility, even at a calculated cost of lives on the field.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf explicitly acknowledges the cost: "others will die, I fear." Yet, he chooses to save Faramir. This represents the theme that the "good" cannot be sacrificed for the "necessary." Saving a single life from a "mad" and "evil" act is as vital as the battle itself.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s description of the conflict at the door characterizes the Enemy's power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A corrosive, psychological agent that fractures the internal social and moral bonds of its opponents, making their own "virtues" work against them.**

**Why this is correct:**
The fight is between servants who both believe they are performing their "duty." Gandalf identifies this as the "work of the Enemy." It shows that Sauron’s true victory is the destruction of Gondor's internal moral clarity, turning its defenders against each other.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s claim that he is "burning" refers to:**

**Correct Answer: B. His internal, consuming state of despair and the psychological "fever" of his own perceived failure, which he projects onto his son and the entire West.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor is speaking metaphorically about his own state of mind. His internal "burning" is the loss of hope that makes his physical suicide seem like a logical conclusion. He sees the world as ash long before he sets the fire.

---

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s rebuke identifies Denethor’s sin as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A spiritual apostasy where his "pride" leads him to usurp divine authority over life and death, effectively surrendering to the "logic" of the Dark Power.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf emphasizes that "Authority is not given to you... to order the hour of your death." Denethor's act is a rejection of the moral order of the West. By choosing to "rule my own end," he adopts the self-centered will of the Enemy.

### Question 5 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The "red fire" that lights Denethor’s face characterizes his "long sight" as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A corruptive and hardening influence that has "petrified" his soul, turning his nobility into a "terrible" monument of despair through unshielded contact with the Enemy.**

**Why this is correct:**
His face looks like it was "cut out of hard stone." This visual change signifies that Denethor has been "overthrown" by what he saw. The "red fire" is the light of the Eye reflected in him. His "long sight" became his "poison."

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s dismissal of Aragorn reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A defensive, institutional pride that prioritizes his own "lordship" over the higher, mythic necessity of the King’s return, characterizing his service as self-serving.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor calls Aragorn an "upstart" and refuses to "step down." This reveals his "stewardship" was a permanent occupation of power. His pride in his "House" prevents him from recognizing the "High" authority of the true heir.

---

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The legend of the Stone symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The permanent, spiritual "scarring" of the artifact by Denethor’s final act of despair, turning a tool of sight into a localized image of self-destruction.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "phantom" image of the withering hands shows how the "Shadow" can permanently corrupt even the greatest tools of wisdom. It serves as a mythic "seal" on Denethor's life—his legacy is the image of his own failure.

---

### Question 8 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The fall of the dome serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Physically and architecturally enact the "breaking" of the line of the Stewards and the end of the Gondor "that you have known."**

**Why this is correct:**
The structural collapse is a narrative symbol for the political collapse. The "Hallows" have been stained. The ruin of the house signifies that the old order is over, clearing the way for the "new" era of the King.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf identifies Denethor’s tragic flaw as:**

**Correct Answer: B. An intellectual arrogance that believed it could handle the truth alone, allowing Sauron to manipulate him through a selective, overwhelming presentation of "true" military might.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sauron controlled Denethor's *perception*. Denethor's "Greatness" made him a perfect target—his intelligence became the vector for his despair because he believed the "Stone" was giving him the *whole* truth.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s recommendation regarding Beregond represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A graceful and wise "Higher" justice that acknowledges the moral necessity of Beregond’s choice, transforming his legal "crime" into an officially sanctioned role of healing.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf’s counsel is a form of mercy. He finds a way to honor Beregond's true loyalty (saving Faramir) while acknowledging the breach of law, effectively "healing" the division within the City's service.
