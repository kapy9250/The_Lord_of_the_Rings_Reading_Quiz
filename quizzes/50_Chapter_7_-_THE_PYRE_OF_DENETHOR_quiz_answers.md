### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s choice to return to the Citadel to save Faramir, despite hearing the "gathering sound of battle" at the Gate, illustrates a leadership priority of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "Higher" moral economy where the prevention of a spiritual and familial atrocity (a father murdering his son) takes precedence over immediate military utility, even at a calculated cost of lives on the field.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf is faced with a choice between the Gate (the war) and the Citadel (Faramir). He explicitly acknowledges the cost: "if I do, then others will die, I fear." Yet, he chooses to save Faramir. This represents the theme that the "good" cannot be sacrificed for the "necessary." Saving a single life from a "mad" and "evil" act is, in Gandalf’s stewardship, as vital as the battle itself, reflecting his commitment to individual value.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
There is no indication Gandalf wants to "use" Faramir; rather, he acts with "anger" and "grief" at Denethor’s madness and a desire to protect a "friend" and a "captain" whose death would be a "black evil."

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s description of the conflict at the Closed Door—"friend at war with friend; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts"—characterizes the Enemy's power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A corrosive, psychological agent that operates by fracturing the internal social and moral bonds of its opponents, making their own "virtues" (like loyalty) work against them in a state of "madness."**

**Why this is correct:**
The fight at the door is between the Lord's servants and Beregond, both of whom believe they are performing their "duty." Gandalf identifies this as the "work of the Enemy." It shows that Sauron’s true victory is not the destruction of Gondor's walls, but the destruction of its internal moral clarity, turning the "valour" of its defenders into a tool for self-slaughter.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text presents Beregond as the "treacherous" savior of Faramir, and Gandalf explicitly calls the situation a "net of warring duties," identifying the *contriver* (Sauron) as the source of the evil, rather than Beregond's individual intent.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s claim that he is "burning, already burning" refers to:**

**Correct Answer: B. His internal, consuming state of despair and the psychological "fever" of his own perceived failure, which he projects onto his son and the entire West, viewing the world as a funeral pyre before the fire is even set.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor is speaking metaphorically about his own state of mind. He believes the "West has failed" and that everything will go up in "fire and smoke." His internal "burning" is the loss of hope that makes his physical self-immolation seem like a logical conclusion. He sees the "house of his spirit" crumbling long before he سناtches the torch.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
He says this *before* he "snatched a torch" and "thrust the brand amid the fuel." The "burning" is a spiritual and psychological state that precedes the literal fire.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s rebuke to Denethor ("only the heathen kings... did thus, slaying themselves in pride and despair") identifies Denethor’s sin as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A spiritual apostasy where his "pride" leads him to usurp divine authority over life and death, effectively surrendering to the "logic" of the Dark Power he spent his life opposing.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf emphasizes that "Authority is not given to you... to order the hour of your death." Denethor's act of suicide (and intended filicide) is a rejection of the moral order of the West. By choosing to "rule my own end," he is adopting the self-centered and absolute will of the Enemy, proving that despair has turned his "High" stewardship into a "heathen" tyranny.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he believes it is honorable, Gandalf frames it as a "sin" of pride and a "madness" that mirrors the "domination of the Dark Power," identifying it as a spiritual failure rather than a cultural virtue.

### Question 5 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The "red fire" that lights Denethor’s face when he reveals the Palantír characterizes his "long sight" as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A corruptive and hardening influence that has "petrified" his soul, turning his nobility into a "terrible" and isolated monument of despair through his direct, unshielded mental contact with the Enemy.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text describes his face as being "lit as with a red fire" and looking like it was "cut out of hard stone." This visual change signifies that Denethor has been "overthrown" by what he saw. The "red fire" is the light of the Eye reflected in him. His "long sight" has become his "poison," because it was unshielded and focused only on the "great might of Mordor."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Denethor is a Man of Numenor (like Aragorn), the "red fire" and the "noble, proud, and terrible" stone-face are intended to show his *contrast* to the "White" light and "new fire" associated with Gandalf and the returning King.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Denethor’s dismissal of Aragorn as "last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A defensive, institutional pride that prioritizes his own "lordship" and the established order of the Stewards over the higher, "mythic" necessity of the King’s return, characterizing his service as self-serving rather than sacrificial.**

**Why this is correct:**
Denethor calls Aragorn an "upstart" and a "Ranger of the North." He refuses to "step down." This reveals that his "stewardship" was not a waiting-in-trust, but a permanent occupation of power. His pride in his "House" prevents him from recognizing the "High" authority of Elendil’s heir, showing that he views Gondor as his personal property rather than a trust to be restored.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Denethor knows the history very well; he explicitly mentions the "line of Isildur." His dismissal is a deliberate, political choice to reject the "ragged house" in favor of his own "Stewardship."

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The legend that anyone who looked in Denethor’s Stone thereafter saw "only two aged hands withering in flame" symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The permanent, spiritual "scarring" of the artifact by Denethor’s final act of despair, turning a tool of global sight into a localized and eternal image of self-destruction and the failure of Gondor’s stewardship.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Palantír, once a tool for "converse in thought," is now "bent" to Denethor's end. This "phantom" image of the withering hands shows how the "Shadow" can permanently corrupt even the greatest tools of wisdom. It serves as a mythic "seal" on Denethor's life—his legacy is not the defense of the city, but the image of his own despairing end.

**Why C is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text says the ball was "unharmed," emphasizing that its *physical* form remained while its *spiritual* or *functional* nature was forever altered by the image of Denethor's death.

---

### Question 8 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The fall of the dome of the House of the Stewards in a "flurry of fire" immediately after Denethor’s death serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Physically and architecturally enact the "breaking" of the line of the Stewards and the end of the Gondor "that you have known," providing a dramatic visual conclusion to Denethor’s "heathen" end.**

**Why this is correct:**
The dome "cracked" and "fell in a flurry of fire." This structural collapse is a narrative symbol for the political and spiritual collapse of the Stewardship. The "Hallows" have been stained by blood and fire. The ruin of the house signifies that the old order of Gondor is literally and metaphorically over, clearing the way for the "new" era of the King.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Faramir *is* now the Steward, the focus of this specific scene is the *destruction* of the past and the "horror" of Denethor's passing, rather than an immediate transition to a new reign.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s explanation of Denethor’s fall—that he was "too great to be subdued... [but] saw nonetheless only those things which that Power permitted"—identifies Denethor’s tragic flaw as:**

**Correct Answer: B. An intellectual arrogance that believed it could handle the truth of the Stone alone, allowing Sauron to manipulate him not through lies, but through a selective, overwhelming presentation of "true" military might that crushed his hope.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf notes that the vision of Mordor's might "fed the despair of his heart." Sauron didn't need to "subdue" Denethor's will; he simply needed to control his *perception*. Denethor's "Greatness" made him a perfect target for this kind of manipulation—his very intelligence became the vector for his despair because he believed the "Stone" was giving him the *whole* truth.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gandalf calls him "great" and "wise" (in the past), characterizing his fall as a moral and psychological error of "pride" rather than a lack of magical power.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s recommendation that Beregond be sent to the Houses of Healing to be the "guard and servant of your captain" represents a:**

**Correct Answer: B. A graceful and wise " Higher" justice that acknowledges the moral necessity of Beregond’s choice, transforming his legal "crime" into an officially sanctioned role of healing and continued loyalty.**

**Why this is correct:**
Beregond has committed "treason" and "stained the hallows" by drawing blood in the tombs. Traditionally, this is a capital crime. Gandalf’s counsel to the chief of the Guard is a form of "Eucatastrophic" mercy. He finds a way to honor Beregond's true loyalty (saving Faramir) while acknowledging the breach of law, effectively "healing" the division within the City's service.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The recommendation is based on the specific *need* for Faramir to have a faithful guard and the recognition of Beregond's *past* act of protection, rather than a desire to remove him from the front lines.
