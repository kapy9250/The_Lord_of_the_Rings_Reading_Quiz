### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s charge against Shelob—described as a "fury... greater than any she had known in countless years"—primarily illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The primal and overwhelming power of "unthinking" devotion, where the total erasure of self-concern in the face of a loved one’s peril creates a martial effectiveness that exceeds that of professional warriors.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that Sam "did not wait to wonder... whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage." His "fury" comes from a place beyond conscious thought—a pure, elemental reaction to Frodo's apparent death. This "small creature" attacking a "tower of horn" is the ultimate expression of the "strength of the weak" that Gandalf often mentioned, proving that Sam's love is a more potent force than Shelob's ancient malice.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Sting is a powerful "elven-blade," the text emphasizes Sam's *actions* and his *fury* as the driving force ("Sam sprang in... stabbed at the clustered eyes"). The sword is his tool, but his "spirit" is what sets its "potency in motion."

### Question 2 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The detail that Shelob’s hide was "ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth" characterizes her existence as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A physical manifestation of accumulated, self-centered malice, where her literal body is a cumulative record of centuries of "evil" consumption and spiritual isolation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Shelob’s body is "knobbed and pitted with corruption." The "layer on layer of evil growth" suggests that her malice is not just a behavior but a biological reality. Her body has become a literal fortification of her own selfishness, making her "impervious" to normal weapons. This reinforces the theme that evil is inherently self-thickening and isolating, a "cloying" force that becomes its own prison.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The description is intended to evoke "horror," "loathing," and "corruption." It is a somber and terrifying characterization of an ancient evil, rather than a humorous observation.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s use of the Phial and his cry in an unknown language ("A tiro nin, Fanuilos!") signifies:**

**Correct Answer: A. A literal, linguistic miracle where the spirit of the West speaks through Sam, validating his "indomitable spirit" and providing him with the celestial authority needed to blast Shelob’s mind with "unbearable pain."**

**Why this is correct:**
The text explicitly says his tongue was "loosed" and he spoke in a language "which he did not know." This is a "Eucatastrophe"—a sudden, miraculous intervention of grace. Sam’s "indomitable spirit" acts as a catalyst for the Phial’s power, allowing the light of Elbereth to work through him. This elevates Sam to a mythic status, where he is momentarily a vessel for the "High" world he admires.

**Why B is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text specifies he "did not know" the language, characterizing the cry as a spontaneous, supernatural event rather than a result of his own academic effort.

---

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s initial "black despair" and his subsequent "rage" against the stones reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological "stages of grief" compressed into a moment of extreme trauma, where the sudden loss of his entire purpose for existence leads to a frantic, albeit futile, externalization of his internal pain.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam goes through a rapid emotional cycle: "black despair," then "night in his heart," then a "rage" where he runs about "stabbing the air" and "shouting challenges." This erratic behavior is a realistic portrayal of a mind overwhelmed by a loss it cannot process. His "rage" is a desperate attempt to find a target for his grief in a world that has suddenly become "ruin."

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
His despair and rage are explicitly linked to his belief that Frodo is dead ("'He's dead!' he said. 'Not asleep, dead!'"). The Ring's influence is mentioned later, after he has composed the body and begun the "debate" about what to do next.

### Question 5 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s "debate" with himself—answering his own doubts with "And the Council gave him companions... the errand must not fail"—indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The internal "Council of conscience," where his inherent common sense and his loyalty to the "Higher" mission override his personal humility and his social deference to his "master."**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam is horrified by the idea of "taking the Ring from him." He feels it is "not for me to go taking the Ring, putting myself forward." However, his "answer" comes from a place of cold, objective logic: "the errand must not fail." This shows Sam's growth; he is able to see beyond his own "servant" role to the universal necessity of the task, making him a true heir to the Company's mission.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Sam calls his choice a "bitter comfort" and a "lonely journey, and the worst." He takes the Ring with "tears" and a "reluctant" heart, showing he has no desire for personal glory or heroism.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s feeling that the Ring was "like a great stone... strung on him" but then "new strength grew in him" suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. The immediate, spiritual "gravity" of the Ring's power, followed by a moment of psychological adaptation where Sam's own "stout" heart begins to provide the necessary counter-force to bear the burden.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "great stone" metaphor illustrates the immediate spiritual weight of the Ring on a "pure" soul like Sam's. His head is "bowed to the ground." The "new strength" is a sign of his internal resilience. He is not being "helped" by the Ring; he is *resisting* it with his own "great effort," allowing him to "walk and bear his burden" despite the crushing pressure.

**Why D is incorrect** `[CC]`:
The text links the "lessening" weight to Sam's own "new strength" and his "great effort," rather than a change in the Ring's nature. In fact, as he approaches the Fire, the Ring’s power and its "burden" are increasing.

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Ring’s effect on Sam’s perception—sharpening his hearing while "sight was dimmed"—characterizes the "Unseen" world as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A state of sensory distortion and isolation, where the physical beauty of the "Seen" world is replaced by a "vague" and "hazy" landscape of fear and surveillance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam notes that the world becomes "vague" and "hazy." He feels "horribly and uniquely visible" to the Eye. This characterizes the "wraith-world" as one of heightened paranoia and sensory imbalance. The sharpening of hearing (the "flat and hard" voices) emphasizes the loss of the visual world's "brightness" and "colour," highlighting the spiritually isolating nature of the Ring's power.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While Elves have keen senses, Sam's experience is described as "vague" and "hazy," and he feels like a "small black solid rock" in a world of "dreams of fear." It is an unsettling and alien state, rather than a positive Elven transformation.

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction to the Orcs' discovery of Frodo ("With a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood") highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The absolute priority of his personal, "domestic" bond over the "High" political or mythic requirements of the Quest, proving that his loyalty to the *person* of Frodo is the ultimate source of his courage.**

**Why this is correct:**
The moment the Orcs see Frodo, Sam "flung the Quest and all his decisions away." He no longer cares about being the "Ring-bearer" or the "errand." His only concern is "at his master's side." This confirms that Sam's character is fundamentally rooted in individual love rather than abstract heroism. This personal devotion is what "wakens" him from the Ring's "cowering" influence.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While he *did* make a tactical error, his *reaction* is not one of strategic regret, but of immediate, emotional commitment to his friend ("My place is by Mr. Frodo"), which he views as more important than the Council's plans.

---

### Question 9 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The overheard conversation between Shagrat and Gorbag regarding the "large warrior loose" primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Illustrate the "Shadow’s" own fear and lack of imagination, where the "un-Great" success of a single hobbit is misinterpreted as the presence of a "mighty Elf," creating a tactical advantage through the enemy's own paranoia.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gorbag's guess—"large warrior loose, Elf most likely"—is a profound irony. It shows that the Enemy cannot conceive of a "small" creature like Sam defeating Shelob. This "blind spot" (which Gandalf also mentioned) is Sam's greatest protection. The Orcs' own "dark rooms" of fear lead them to over-estimate their opponent, creating the "confusion" that Sam can later exploit.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Sam "smiled grimly" at this description, showing he recognizes the irony and is prepared to use this "new" reputation to his advantage, rather than feeling any kinship with the Orcs.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s reaction to the news that Frodo is alive ("Sam reeled... the whole dark world was turning upside down") reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The devastating psychological impact of his own "hope-less" choice, where the "logical" decision to take the Ring is revealed as a catastrophic moral failure of trust in his own heart’s intuition.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s "swoon" is a result of intense guilt. He realizes he "got it all wrong." By trusting his "head" (the logical conclusion that Frodo was dead) over his "heart" (which "knew" he wasn't), Sam inadvertently abandoned his master to the enemy. This "turning upside down" is the realization that his act of "responsibility" was actually an act of "folly" and "faithlessness" in his own eyes.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he *will* eventually be relieved, his *immediate* reaction is one of "wild fury" at his own error ("I got it all wrong!") and a desperate, frantic need to "get back to him" to correct his betrayal.
