### Question 1 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s comment that "Saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his Orcs" and used "Men to guard his gates" suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. Saruman’s recognition of the inherent treachery and instability of Orcish loyalty, requiring a more "rational" and reliable human buffer to secure his most vital perimeter.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry notes that Saruman "had Men to guard his gates" because he didn't trust his Orcs. This highlights Saruman's cynicism and his reliance on human collaborators who could provide a level of disciplined, focused service that the chaotic and "mauling" Orcs could not. It characterizes his "Power" as one built on various layers of unreliable and potentially treacherous servants.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While the Men were "favoured," the text doesn't suggest they were physically stronger than the Uruk-hai; rather, they were more "trusty" in Saruman's eyes for specific roles like guarding the gates.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s choice to keep an "unused" pipe "near my skin" and his comment that it is "precious as Rings to me" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological importance of maintaining a connection to the Shire's domestic identity, where small, seemingly "useless" objects of comfort act as vital talismans against the dehumanizing terror of the quest.**

**Why this is correct:**
Pippin calls the pipe a "treasure" and keeps it "near my skin." In a world of "whips and filth," these Shire artifacts represent his core self. By gifting it to Gimli, he performs an act of fellowship that settles "the score," proving that his "hobbitness"—his focus on small comforts and shared peace—has survived the "nightmare" of his capture.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Pippin uses "Rings" as a metaphor for the pipe's personal value ("precious as Rings *to me*"), rather than expressing a literal desire for the One Ring or its power.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s statement that "One who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters" provides a moral commentary on:**

**Correct Answer: B. The fundamental difference between "possession" and "freedom," suggesting that true power lies in the ability to sacrifice what is "precious" for a higher purpose, a quality that Sauron and Saruman lack.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn praises Pippin for casting away the brooch. He identifies the inability to let go as a form of imprisonment ("fetters"). This is a central philosophical point in the book: those who cling to power (like Sauron) or objects are enslaved by them. Aragorn's perspective validates the hobbits' "un-Great" but essential ability to act selflessly.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The brooch is a "very precious thing" and a gift from the Lady, but there is no suggestion it is cursed. The "fetters" Aragorn speaks of are internal and moral, not external and magical.

### Question 4 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s description of the "Huorn-dark" and the feeling that "the Forest itself was moving" creates a tone of:**

**Correct Answer: B. Primal, elemental dread, characterizing the Huorns as a half-sentient, barely-controlled force of nature that represents the untamed and "wild" rage of the woods.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry describes the Huorns as "queer and wild" and "dangerous." He is "terrified" of them without the Ents to "look after them." The "creaking" air and the "shadow" they cast create an atmosphere of supernatural horror, showing that nature's retaliation is not necessarily "friendly" or "fair," but a terrifying, focused force of destruction.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text emphasizes the "terror" and the "shadow one couldn't see through," characterizing the Huorns as a dark and menacing presence rather than a whimsical or lighthearted one.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s assessment of Saruman’s "power over the minds of others" suggests that Saruman’s greatest danger is:**

**Correct Answer: B. His rhetorical and psychological sophistication, which allows him to manipulate the perceptions and loyalties of others through speech alone, even after his physical military power has been destroyed.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn warns that "very few" are safe if left alone to talk with Saruman. This characterizes Saruman's true "wizardry" as psychological manipulation. Even in defeat, his voice remains a weapon that can "persuade" the wise and "daunt" the small. It prepares the reader for the upcoming "parley" at Orthanc and identifies the battle as one of wills and truth.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While Saruman used machinery to take the Wall, Aragorn identifies his *persuasive power* as the skill he "certainly still keeps," making it the more persistent and insidious threat.

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s observation that Saruman "has not much grit... alone in a tight place without a lot of slaves and machines" characterizes the wizard’s evil as:**

**Correct Answer: B. Dependent on external systems of control and industrial power, revealing an underlying moral and personal hollowness that fails when his "tools" are removed.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry compares Saruman unfavorably to Gandalf. He identifies Saruman's reliance on "slaves and machines" as a sign of his lack of "grit" or internal courage. This suggests that Saruman's evil is not a source of strength, but a compensation for his own internal vacuum of character, which collapses when he is "closeted" and without his "Power."

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Merry's tone is one of insightful observation ("if you know what I mean") rather than arrogance. He is analyzing the nature of the "Power" they have just witnessed being overthrown.

### Question 7 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of Isengard as a "huge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling" at the end of the flood serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Symbolically "neutralize" the toxic and unquiet nature of Saruman’s furnaces by transforming the entire stronghold into a literal vessel of its own destruction and purification.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "saucepan" metaphor domesticates the horror of Isengard. The "fires were quenched" and the "filth of Saruman... washed away." This visual of "steaming and bubbling" signifies the return of elemental water to a place that had been defined by "venomous" fire and smoke. It is an image of radical, natural cleaning.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While the metaphor is domestic, the narrative purpose is to illustrate the *total transformation* of the landscape and the "end of it all," rather than just to provide a joke.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s "tom-fool of a Took" greeting to Pippin at the gate, followed by his hurried meeting with Treebeard, primarily reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The intense, high-level strategic coordination between Gandalf and Treebeard, where their "unhasty" meeting masks a profound, shared sense of urgency regarding the next phase of the war.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf is in a "tremendous hurry" and "talking at a great pace." He needs Treebeard to "manage" the Wizard while he deals with "ten thousand Orcs." Their meeting is a "council" of two ancient powers. Gandalf's sharp tongue with Pippin is his way of maintaining his role as guide while focusing his attention on the "perilous night" and the "mighty matter" at hand.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he calls him a "tom-fool," the subsequent "relieved, almost merry" mood shows that Gandalf is genuinely glad to see them, and his "sharpness" is a result of his intense focus on the war rather than genuine anger.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Treebeard’s "grimly delighted" treatment of Wormtongue, forcing him to cross the flood to reach Orthanc, suggests that:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deliberate, poetic justice where the "snake" is forced to crawl through the "slime" of his own master's ruin to reach the master he served so faithfully through betrayal.**

**Why this is correct:**
Treebeard calls him a "draggled rat" and laughs as he watches his progress. He forces Wormtongue into the "dirty" water, literalizing the moral "slime" of his character. This is a moment of natural judgment; the Ent, representing the "unhasty" and "honest" forest, has no patience for the "witless worm" and sends him back to the "trap" he helped build.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text says Wormtongue "cannot swim" and "clutched at some old barrel," emphasizing his physical struggle and his lack of skill, making his crossing a humiliating and difficult ordeal.

---

### Question 10 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s suspicion regarding the "leaf from the Southfarthing" in Isengard points toward a growing concern about:**

**Correct Answer: B. The realization that Saruman’s reach and influence (and potentially his espionage network) extend far beyond the immediate war zone, threatening the internal security of the Shire itself.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn notes that "neither goods nor folk have passed that way... openly." The presence of the 1417 crop in Isengard is proof of "secret dealings." This realizes the fear expressed in Chapter 10—that the "Shadow" has eyes everywhere. It identifies the Shire as a place that is already being infiltrated and corrupted from within by Saruman’s "Wormtongues."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn is clearly speaking to the *hobbits* about an external threat *to* their land, rather than accusing them of involvement. He is identifying a new, "unlooked-for" danger to their "beloved holes."
