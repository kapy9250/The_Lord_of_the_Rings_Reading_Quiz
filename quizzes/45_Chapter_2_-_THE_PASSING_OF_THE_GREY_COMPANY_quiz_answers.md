### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s feeling that he is "unneeded baggage" and his subsequent decision to offer his sword to Théoden reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound psychological need to transition from a passive, protected "child" role to an active, recognized participant in the heroic narrative, grounding his identity in a formal bond of service.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry explicitly says he doesn't want to be "laid aside, like baggage." His act of kneeling and offering his sword is a conscious decision to enter the "High" world of Rohan's martial culture. By becoming an "esquire of Rohan," he transforms his status from a victim of capture to a sworn servant of the King, providing him with a sense of purpose and "honour" that counters his earlier dismal feelings.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Théoden *is* a father-figure to him ("As a father you shall be to me"), but the primary motivation for the *fealty* is Merry's internal desire to be "of use" and to "repay his debt" to the kind treatment he has received, rather than a search for physical protection.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The arrival of the "Grey Company"—thirty Rangers and the sons of Elrond—marks a shift in the conflict from:**

**Correct Answer: B. The spontaneous, spiritual "answering" of the world to Aragorn’s internal need, signaling the beginning of his transition from a solitary Ranger to a leader who commands the loyalty of his own "High" kindred.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn admits he did not summon them "save only in wish." Their arrival is a "least expected" joy. This reflects the theme of "unseen ordering." The Rangers bring with them the "livery of the heirs of Elendil," marking Aragorn's emergence as the Chieftain of the Dúnedain. It is the first step in his assembly of a legitimate royal following, moving the story from a fugitive chase to a royal restoration.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While they are elite warriors, the text emphasizes their "fewness" (only thirty). Their significance is symbolic and historical (the "Grey Company" of prophecy) rather than being presented as a conventional army capable of "storming" the Black Gate.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s startling physical change after looking in the Stone—seeming as if "many years had fallen on his head"—indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The staggering psychological and spiritual toll of a direct, mental confrontation with the Dark Lord, where the exertion of his "will of adamant" has drained his physical vitality.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn calls it a "bitter struggle" and a "struggle somewhat grimmer than the battle of the Hornburg." He has wrestled the Stone to his "own will." This mental combat with Sauron is a supreme test of his spirit. His "grey-hued and weary" face is the physical price of his spiritual victory, illustrating that the "Right" to the Stone does not make the "Strength" to use it any less costly.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he is "weary," the text describes his face as "grim" and his eyes as "glinting" with resolve. He has asserted his "will" over the Ring's Master, which is the opposite of the "yielding" and "thinning" process that characterizes a Wraith.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s use of the Palantír to "reveal" himself to Sauron, showing the "blade re-forged," is a strategic move intended to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Provoke a "hasty stroke" from the Enemy by introducing a new, ancient fear (the return of Isildur’s heir), thereby creating a tactical distraction that might aid Frodo’s "secret" journey.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn says "the hasty stroke goes oft astray." By revealing himself and the Sword, he forces Sauron to focus on the threat of a returning King in Gondor. He believes this "blow to his heart" will cause Sauron to act prematurely or focus his "Eye" away from his own borders, providing a momentary "doubt" that might help the "Bearers" move unnoticed.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Aragorn describes himself as having "barely" enough strength and being "troubled in mind." His move is a calculated, desperate gamble based on his "right," rather than an expression of overconfidence.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Éowyn’s "torment of mind" and her bitter remark ("Shall I always be chosen... to mind the house while they win renown?") reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The profound existential "suffocation" of a heroic and martial spirit trapped within restrictive gender and social roles, where the "duty" of protection is experienced as a "cage" of powerlessness.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éowyn explicitly names her fear as "a cage." She identifies as a "shieldmaiden," not a "dry-nurse" or a "serving-woman." Her bitterness comes from her desire to face "peril and battle" alongside the men she admires. Her "torment" is the conflict between her high-noble duty to govern the people and her intense, individual hunger for "renown" and "great deeds" in the field.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
She expresses a desire to "ride in [Aragorn's] following" and to "face peril," focusing on the act of *warfare* and the achievement of *glory* rather than a specific desire for political rank or power over others.

### Question 6 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "single mighty stone like a finger of doom" at the entrance to the Dimholt serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Visually and symbolically mark the threshold into a "liminal" space where the laws of the living are suspended, acting as a physical "warning" from the ancient, accursed past.**

**Why this is correct:**
The stone is described as "mighty" and "threatening." It causes even the horses to refuse the path. Narratively, it marks the transition from the "Seen" world of Rohan to the "Unseen" realm of the Dead. It is a sentinel of "doom," signaling to the reader that the Company is entering a space where the normal rules of survival and heroism no longer apply.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The tone is one of "dread," "chill blood," and "dead voice." The stone is presented as a somber and terrifying landmark of the "Accursed Years," with no lighthearted or humorous intent.

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s " blindness" and his feeling that his feet were "like lead" upon entering the Dark Door illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The intense, crushing weight of ancestral and spiritual "dread" that even the most grounded and "unaing" Dwarf feels when entering a realm defined by broken oaths and un-living malice.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli is "wroth with himself" because an "Elf will go underground and a Dwarf dare not!" His fear is profound because it challenges his very identity as a Dwarf who is usually "unafraid in many deep places." The "blindness" and the "lead" feet are physical manifestations of a spiritual crisis—the encounter with a "Shadow" that his own nature is ill-equipped to handle.

**Why C is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Gimli has walked through Moria and many other caves. His fear here is specifically about the "Dark Door" and the "unseen host" of the Dead, rather than a general fear of darkness.

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The discovery of the "bones of a mighty man" clawing at the fast-closed stony door serves as a:**

**Correct Answer: B. Gruesome and final reminder of the futility of individual struggle against the "Accursed Years" and the absolute finality of the Dead’s imprisonment, heightening the stakes of Aragorn’s "errand."**

**Why this is correct:**
The man (Baldor) has lain there for generations, his "finger-bones... still clawing." This image of "despair" at a "door that he could not unlock" summarizes the tragedy of the Paths of the Dead. It shows that even the "mighty" cannot pass through this darkness by force. This sets the stage for Aragorn's "High" success—he opens the way not by "hewing at the rock" but by his royal authority.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The skeleton's presence is a narrative "dead end" (literally) that emphasizes the hopelessness of the man's attempt, rather than providing any useful information about the path ahead.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s summons to the Dead—"To the Stone of Erech! I seek the Paths of the Dead. Come with me who will!"—identifies his authority as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme, ontological authority that bridges the gap between life and death, using his identity as the "Heir" to offer the only possible "peace" to a people bound by a three-thousand-year-old curse.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn addresses them as "Oathbreakers" and demands "why have ye come?" He offers them "peace" in exchange for the fulfillment of their oath. This is an act of sovereign judgment. He is not "using" them; he is providing the legal and spiritual "conclusion" to their suffering. This marks his highest moment of "White" authority before the final battle.

**Why C is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Aragorn explicitly states his purpose is the "fulfillment of the oath" so that they may "depart for ever." He is releasing them from their un-life, which is the opposite of a necromancer's desire to control the dead for his own power.

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The final image of the Grey Company passing into the "darkness of the Storm of Mordor" and being "lost to mortal sight" signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The transition of the narrative into a "mythic" and invisible dimension, where the traditional army of the West has been replaced by a "Shadow Host" that operates beyond the perception and logic of the mortal world.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "Grey Company" is now accompanied by the "Dead" who follow behind. They move with "greatest haste and weariness" into a "darkness" where there is "no dawn." This imagery suggests that Aragorn has entered a legendary space. He is no longer just a captain leading Men; he is a mythic figure leading a supernatural force through the "Storm," marking the story's final escalation into epic fantasy.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text notes the "dread of the Shadows" and the "fear" that went before them. While the Dead are now his "allies" in fulfilling their oath, the relationship is one of "terror" and "darkness" rather than friendship.
