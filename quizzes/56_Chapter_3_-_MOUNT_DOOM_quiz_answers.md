### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s realization that there would be "no return" and his subsequent feeling of turning into "stone and steel" signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme, internal "hardening" where the death of personal hope triggers a final, absolute crystallization of the will, allowing him to perform a purely sacrificial duty without the need for future reward.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam works out that their provisions are only enough for a one-way trip. Once "hope died" in him, he didn't give up; instead, his will "hardened." He accepts that he is going to his death to help Frodo. This "stone and steel" quality is his final heroic evolution—moving from a cheerful "Shire-hobbit" to a grim, purely sacrificial figure whose only motivation is the fulfillment of his "job."

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text uses "stone and steel" as a *metaphor* for his internal "will," contrasting it with his "plain hobbit-face," rather than suggesting a literal environmental or biological change.

### Question 2 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s refusal to let Sam carry the Ring, crying "No you won't, you thief!" before the mist clears from his eyes, illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The Ring’s final, desperate attempt to isolate the Bearer by distorting his most sacred bond (friendship) into a predatory threat, characterizing the "doom" as an inescapable and solitary possession.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s outburst is described as a "hideous vision." The Ring makes him see Sam as an "orc... leering and pawing." This is the Ring's primary defense at the very edge of the Fire: it uses Frodo's exhaustion and fear to turn his only ally into an enemy. The "mist" that clears shows that Frodo is almost completely "wraith-like" in his perceptions, saved only by his sudden, internal shock at his own cruelty.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Frodo immediately repents, crying "O Sam! What have I said?" and blaming the "horrible power of the Ring," proving that his true character remains one of love and trust for Sam, despite the Ring's temporary distortion.

### Question 3 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The detail that the "path was not put there for the purposes of Sam" but was Sauron’s own Road from Barad-dûr to the Chambers of Fire, emphasizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic irony of the Enemy’s "industry," where the very infrastructure built to serve his own absolute Mastery inadvertently provides the only possible path for his own destruction.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam sees the road as a "luck" or a "gleam of hope." The fact that it is *Sauron’s* road is a masterstroke of narrative irony. Sauron's need for a high-speed, well-maintained path to his own forges is exactly what allows the exhausted hobbits to reach the Sammath Naur. His "Mastery" over the physical landscape becomes the very mechanism of his downfall.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "hope," "desperate," and "ominous." The road is presented as a crucial and unexpected "miracle" of survival rather than a source of Shire-like comedy.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s state upon reaching the Sammath Naur—standing "tense, erect, but still as if he had been turned to stone"—represents a moment of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The absolute "breaking point" of the spirit, where the total convergence of external pressure (the Eye) and internal weight (the Ring) results in a spiritual paralysis at the threshold of the final decision.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is at the "very Crack of Doom." He is "black against the glare." This stillness is the silence before the storm of his final refusal. He is "tense" because his entire being is caught in the final, crushing grip of the Ring's Master. This paralysis precedes his ultimate fall—the decision to claim the Ring for himself.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While the chamber is "dark and hot," the "stone" imagery is used to describe his *posture* and his *lack of movement*, characterizing his state as a psychological and spiritual "stasis" rather than a biological reaction to temperature.

### Question 5 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s proclamation—"I do not choose now to do what I came to do. ... The Ring is mine!"—marks the total:**

**Correct Answer: B. Failure of the individual "will" before the absolute and corruptive power of the Ring at the site of its greatest potency, where the Bearer's identity is finally subsumed by the Ring’s own desire for Mastery.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo speaks with a "clearer and more powerful" voice than ever before. This is the "Ring-voice." At the center of its power, the Ring has successfully bypassed Frodo's "choice." By saying "I do not choose," Frodo identifies the end of his moral agency. This failure is the ultimate tragedy of the Bearer: he is overwhelmed at the last possible inch of the journey.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The Council's plan was to *destroy* the Ring. Frodo's decision to *keep* it is the absolute disaster they all feared, the moment where the Quest has "failed utterly," as Frodo himself previously predicted.

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Sauron’s reaction to Frodo putting on the Ring—his fear rising "like a vast black smoke" and his Eye "piercing all shadows"—characterizes his Power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A fragile and derivative system of control that is entirely dependent on a single, external "foundational" object, making his entire global architecture vulnerable to a single, localized act of destruction.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sauron is "suddenly aware" of Frodo. His entire realm "trembles." His armies "halt" and his captains are "steerless" because his mind is now "bent with overwhelming force upon the Mountain." This reveals that Sauron's strength is not self-sustaining; it is an extension of the Ring. Once the Ring is threatened, his entire political and military web collapses into "haste and fear."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Sauron's fear comes from his realization of the "magnitude of his own folly" and the "deadly peril" he is in, rather than a misperception of the hobbits' physical power.

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s "dance" on the edge of the abyss, crying "Precious, precious!" while holding the Ring, illustrates the:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, self-destructive ecstasy of absolute possession, where the fulfillment of his lifelong obsession results in a total loss of situational awareness and his final fall into the fire.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum is "dancing like a mad thing." He is "gloating on his prize." His joy at having the "Precious" back is so absolute that he literally "steps too far." This is the final irony of his character: his successful reclamation of the Ring is the very thing that kills him and destroys the object he loves. His "ecstasy" is his "doom."

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gollum's only thought is "My Precious!", and his fall is described as an accident of his own "mad" gloating rather than an act of sacrificial heroism.

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s conclusion—"But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed the Ring. The Quest would have been in vain"—vindicates Gandalf’s belief in:**

**Correct Answer: B. The "Eucatastrophic" role of the wretched and the small, where even the most "wicked" actions (Gollum’s betrayal) are turned by a higher providence into the necessary catalyst for the world’s salvation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo failed at the Crack of Doom. The Ring was only destroyed because of Gollum's attack. This fulfills Gandalf's early warning that Gollum had "something yet to do." It proves that in Tolkien's world, mercy (sparing Gollum) is not just a moral choice, but a strategic one that ultimately allows the "good" to prevail through the "unforeseen" actions of the broken.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text emphasizes that Frodo *refused* to do the deed ("The Quest would have been in vain"), making Gollum's individual and "wicked" intervention the *necessary* cause of the destruction, rather than an inevitability.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Nazgûl at the end—"crackled, withered, and went out" like "flaming bolts"—characterizes their end as:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total, non-sentient "extinguishing" of a derivative power once its foundational source (the Ring) is removed, turning the "terror of the air" into mere sparks in a larger, natural storm.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Nazgûl do not die heroic deaths; they "wither and go out." They are "caught in the fiery ruin" of their own master’s foundation. This reinforces the idea that they were never truly alive, but were "living ghosts" sustained by the Ring. Once the "One" is gone, their own "nothingness" (as Gandalf called it) is all that remains, and they vanish like smoke.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The imagery of "crackling" and "withering" in a "torrent of black rain" is intended to be a climactic and terrifying visual summary of their absolute annihilation, rather than a humorous comparison.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s state after the Ring’s destruction—with "peace now" in his eyes, "neither strain of will, nor madness"—represents a:**

**Correct Answer: B. The profound, "quiet" restoration of his original self, where the removal of the Ring's "Mastery" allows his "plain" hobbit-spirit to return from the brink of the abyss, marking the end of his spiritual "thinning."**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is "himself again." The "burden was taken away." This is the first time since Book 1 that he is free of the Ring's psychological "strain." The "peace" in his eyes is his reward for his long suffering. He is "pale and worn," but he is no longer "wraith-like." He has been restored to his own "small" but whole identity.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Frodo explicitly mentions Gandalf's words and the achievement of the Quest, proving he remembers the journey and its "bitter end" very well, though the *burden* of the Ring is gone.
