### Question 1 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s charge reveals a kingship based on:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "solar" heroic vitality that seeks to confront the "black serpent" of the South directly, using the moral momentum of his restored identity to shatter the enemy’s prestige.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden is described as "cloving through the Southrons like a fire-bolt." His charge is not a tactical error but a supreme manifestation of his "new fire." He seeks the enemy's standard to destroy it personally. This "white fury" is the ultimate expression of his restored honor.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Witch-king’s steed characterizes the Shadow’s power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A parasitic and perverse manipulation of primeval life, where the "horrors" of the past are artificially amplified to serve a contemporary, industrial malice.**

**Why this is correct:**
The creature is an "untimely brood" from "forgotten mountains," which the Dark Lord "took" and "nursed." This emphasizes that Sauron’s power is not creative but exploitative. He perverts natural (if "apt to evil") leftovers of previous ages to serve his own political ends.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s "slow-kindled courage" indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological process of overcoming "wraith-fear," where the Hobbit’s innate empathy for his "fair, desperate" companion provides the moral spark needed to ignite his dormant bravery.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry is "dazed" until he sees Éowyn. His "amazement" at her true identity conquers his fear. His courage is not a martial skill but a relational one: he cannot let her "die alone, unaided." This "slow-kindled" fire is the specific hobbitic contribution to the battle.

---

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Witch-king’s dismissal of Éowyn illustrates his:**

**Correct Answer: B. The fatal "literalism" of evil, which relies on a rigid interpretation of prophecy and a lack of imaginative empathy to protect itself, leaving it vulnerable to the "unforeseen" reality of a female warrior.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Witch-king believes his immunity is absolute based on the words "not by the hand of man." He cannot conceive of a "woman" or a "hobbit" as significant actors. This intellectual blindness is his "Achilles heel," reinforcing the theme that evil often ignores the "unimportant" people who decide the fate of the world.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s final words signify:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total restoration of his internal honor and ancestral worthiness, where the "shame" of his dotage is replaced by the "glory" of his final stand.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden’s primary struggle was against his own "failing" and the "shame" of being manipulated. By dying in battle, he has fulfilled all his oaths. His lack of "shame" before his ancestors is the ultimate sign of his moral victory. He dies as a "King."

---

### Question 6 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "smoking" and "withering" of the sword reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The intense, "radioactive" malevolence of the undead King, whose spiritual "anti-life" is so potent that even the magic of Westernesse is consumed in the act of cleaving it.**

**Why this is correct:**
The blade "writhed and withered." This shows that the Witch-king's own corrupt essence acts like a physical acid. It emphasizes the "bitter" and costly nature of the wound dealt to the Shadow—even the weapon used to strike it is sacrificed.

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Éomer’s "fey mood" characterizes his grief as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A descent into a nihilistic, suicidal battle-frenzy where the loss of his "last" kin shatters his strategic restraint, turning his generalship into a catastrophic search for an end.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éomer calls for "ruin and the world's ending." He is no longer trying to win the battle, but rather to find his own "death." His "cold fury" represents the breaking point of the heroic spirit when faced with the absolute loss of all family and hope.

---

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The appearance of the "Black Ships" illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The extreme fragility of hope in Minas Tirith, where the visual arrival of a known threat is interpreted as the final confirmation of Gondor's total annihilation.**

**Why this is correct:**
The defenders see the sails and immediately assume the worst. Their hope "dies in their hearts." This illustrates the power of Sauron's psychological warfare: he uses the *expectation* of defeat to paralyze his enemies. The ships are a "sign" that Gondor's last hope has failed.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s unfurling of the standard represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The "Eucatastrophic" return of the true, high-noble authority of Gondor, where the hidden symbols of the past are physically manifested to drive back the "Black" despair.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn transforms the "Black Ships" into a source of "mirth" and "joy." This is the ultimate narrative reversal: the very thing that caused "doom" becomes the thing that brings "victory." It is the "Dawn" of the King's return made visible.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The *Song of the Mounds of Mundburg* serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Transform the "gritty" and "bloody" reality of the fields into a timeless, cultural memory, honoring the "league of friendship" between Rohan and Gondor through a shared narrative of sacrifice.**

**Why this is correct:**
By turning the battle into a formal "Song," the culture of the West reclaims its meaning from the "carrion-birds." The poem validates the "worth" of their deaths, ensuring that the "white fury" of the day will be remembered through the "grey years" to come.
