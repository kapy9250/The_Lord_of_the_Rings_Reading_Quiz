### Question 1 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s headlong charge to meet the Haradrim chieftain, despite being outnumbered, reveals a kingship based on:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "solar" heroic vitality that seeks to confront the "black serpent" of the South directly, using superior skill and the moral momentum of his restored identity to shatter the enemy’s prestige.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden is described as "cloving through the Southrons like a fire-bolt." His charge is not a tactical error but a supreme manifestation of his "new fire." He seeks the enemy's standard (the black serpent) to destroy it personally. This "white fury" is the ultimate expression of his restored honor, proving that his "High" kingship is more powerful than the "red wrath" of the Haradrim.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text notes that "Theoden was aware of him" and "would not wait for his onset," characterizing his charge as a deliberate choice of heroic confrontation rather than a naive belief in his own physical safety (as shown by his eventual fall).

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Lord of the Nazgûl’s steed as "a creature of an older world" that was "nursed with fell meats" characterizes the Shadow’s power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A parasitic and perverse manipulation of ancient, primeval life, where the "horrors" of the past are artificially sustained and amplified to serve a contemporary, industrial malice.**

**Why this is correct:**
The narrator suggests the creature is an "untimely brood" from "forgotten mountains," which the Dark Lord "took" and "nursed." This emphasizes that Sauron’s power is not creative but exploitative. He takes the natural (if "apt to evil") leftovers of previous ages and perverts them through "fell meats" to create a "measure" of terror that serves his own modern, political ends.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While both fly, the description of the fell beast focuses on its "naked" skin, its "stench," and its "hideous eyrie," characterizing it as an abominable and un-natural anti-type to the noble and feathered eagles.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s initial "blind and sick" horror when the Shadow arrives, and his subsequent "slow-kindled courage," indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological process of overcoming "wraith-fear," where the Hobbit’s innate empathy for his "fair, desperate" companion (Éowyn) provides the moral spark needed to ignite his dormant, ancestral bravery.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry is "dazed" and "blind" until he sees Éowyn. His "amazement" at her true identity "conquered [his] fear." His courage is not a martial skill but a relational one: he cannot let her "die alone, unaided." This "slow-kindled" fire is the specific hobbitic contribution to the battle—a small, empathetic act that punctures the "absolute" terror of the Shadow.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text attributes his courage to his "pity" and "wonder" for Éowyn, rather than any protection from the Ring (which is currently with Frodo in Mordor).

---

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Witch-king’s dismissal of Éowyn as a "fool" because "No living man may hinder me!" illustrates his:**

**Correct Answer: B. The fatal "literalism" of evil, which relies on a rigid interpretation of prophecy and a lack of imaginative empathy to protect itself, leaving it vulnerable to the "unforeseen" reality of a female warrior.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Witch-king believes his immunity is absolute based on the words "not by the hand of man." He cannot conceive of a "woman" or a "hobbit" as significant actors. This intellectual and moral blindness is his "Achilles heel." It reinforces the theme that the "Wise" (and the "Evil") often ignore the "unimportant" people who ultimately decide the world's fate.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
His tone is one of "contempt" and "cold voice," and he threatens to "bear thee away to the houses of lamentation," characterizing his interaction as one of absolute arrogance rather than politeness.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s final words to Merry ("I go to my fathers. And even in their mighty company I shall not now be ashamed") signify:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total restoration of his internal honor and his ancestral worthiness, where the "shame" of his former dotage is replaced by the "glory" of his final stand, validating his entire life-arc.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden’s primary struggle was against his own "failing" and the "shame" of being manipulated by Wormtongue. By "felling the black serpent" and dying in battle, he has "fulfilled all his oaths." His lack of "shame" before his "mighty company" (his ancestors) is the ultimate sign of his moral victory. He dies as a "King" in his own eyes and the eyes of his people.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
He explicitly mentions her: "I would send word to Eowyn. ... dearer than daughter." His death is marked by his love for his family and his people, as well as his heroic fulfillment.

---

### Question 6 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "smoking" and "withering" of Merry’s sword after he strikes the Witch-king reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The intense, "radioactive" malevolence of the undead King, whose spiritual "anti-life" is so potent that even the ancient, anti-wraith magic of Westernesse is consumed in the act of cleaving it.**

**Why this is correct:**
The sword was "work of Westernesse" and had spells designed specifically for the "sorcerer king." The fact that it "writhed and withered" after the blow shows that the Witch-king's own corrupt essence acts like a physical acid or fire. It emphasizes the "bitter" and costly nature of the wound dealt to the Shadow—even the weapon used to strike it is sacrificed.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text explicitly *praises* the blade's origin and the skill of its maker, noting that "no other blade... would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter." Its destruction is a result of the Witch-king's supernatural power, not poor steel.

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Éomer’s "fey mood" upon seeing Éowyn’s body—crying "Death, death, death!" and riding to "ruin and the world's ending"—characterizes his grief as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A descent into a nihilistic, suicidal battle-frenzy where the loss of his "last" kin (after Théoden) shatters his strategic restraint, turning his generalship into a personal and catastrophic search for an end.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éomer stands "white and silent" before exploding into "fey" fury. He calls for "ruin and the world's ending." This is a loss of generalship; he is no longer trying to win the battle, but rather to find his own "death" in the midst of it. His "cold fury" represents the breaking point of the heroic spirit when faced with the absolute loss of all hope and family.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text notes he acted "without taking counsel or waiting," characterizing his onset as an impulsive, grief-driven reaction rather than a calculated tactical maneuver.

---

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The appearance of the "Black Ships" and the subsequent "last stroke of doom" felt by the defenders illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The extreme fragility of hope in Minas Tirith, where the visual arrival of a known, historical threat (Umbar) is interpreted as the final confirmation of Gondor's total annihilation.**

**Why this is correct:**
The defenders see the "black sails" and immediately assume "Belfalas is taken... Lebennin is gone." Their hope "dies in their hearts." This illustrates the power of Sauron's psychological warfare: he uses the *expectation* of defeat to paralyze his enemies. The ships are a "sign" that Gondor's last hope (help from the south) has failed, creating a "last stroke of doom."

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While the "red sun" is mentioned later, the immediate reaction to the ships is one of political and military "dismay," focusing on the perceived loss of Gondor's southern fiefs rather than the time of day.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s unfurling of the "Seven Stars" and the "High Crown" standard represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The "Eucatastrophic" return of the true, high-noble authority of Gondor, where the hidden "White" symbols of the past are physically manifested to drive back the "Black" despair of the present.**

**Why this is correct:**
The standard is "wrought of mithril and gold" by Arwen. It is the "sign of Elendil." By unfurling it, Aragorn transforms the "Black Ships" into a source of "mirth" and "joy." This is the ultimate narrative reversal: the very thing that caused "doom" (the ships) becomes the thing that brings "victory." It is the "Dawn" of the King's return made visible.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn is riding "to the kingdom of Gondor" and "to battle," asserting his royal presence in Middle-earth rather than seeking an exit from it.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The final poem, the *Song of the Mounds of Mundburg*, serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Transform the "gritty" and "bloody" reality of the fields into a timeless, cultural memory, honoring the "league of friendship" between Rohan and Gondor through a shared, sacred narrative of sacrifice.**

**Why this is correct:**
The song lists the names of the fallen ("Harding and Guthlaf... Forlong the old"). It describes them as "league-fellows" lying "under grass in Gondor." By turning the battle into a formal "Song," the culture of the West reclaims its meaning from the "carrion-birds." The poem validates the "worth" of their deaths, ensuring that the "white fury" of the day will be remembered through the "grey years" to come.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While names are listed, the poem is a commemorative *lament* focused on the *meaning* and *tragedy* of the loss, rather than a purely statistical or administrative military report.
