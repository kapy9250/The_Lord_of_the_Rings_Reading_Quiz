### Question 1 `[SCA/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s recitation of the poem serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Evoke the specific cultural "mood" of Rohan: a heroic but elegiac sensibility that defines identity through the memory of transience and the inevitability of the "shadow."**

**Why this is correct:**
The poem focuses on the loss of the physical world ("the horse and the rider"). By reciting it, Aragorn identifies Rohan as a culture that finds its highest expression in "song" and "memory" of past greatness, even as it faces its own "fading." It sets the tonal stage for the "resurrection" of the King.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that labels a core cultural value as a "failing."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "secret spies."
- **D** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about the hall "physically vanishing."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "magically influencing gates."

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The guard’s observation that Gandalf looks "fell and grim beneath" captures:**

**Correct Answer: B. The fundamental discrepancy between Gandalf’s "Grey" exterior and his newly revealed "White" spiritual intensity, which even a common man can intuit as a formidable power.**

**Why this is correct:**
The guard perceives the "White Rider" beneath the "Greyhame" mask. This reflects the theme of "gold that does not glitter." Gandalf’s physical appearance is a mask for a being who has passed through "fire and death." The guard's recognition prepares the reader for the unmasking of Wormtongue.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Comedy" distractor about "secret Orcs."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about the guard being "wiser than the King."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about a "deceptive act."
- **E** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "dirty robes."

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s refusal to lay down Andúril represent:**

**Correct Answer: B. The re-assertion of an ancient, absolute royal sovereignty that exists independently of local laws, marking Aragorn's transition to a King who issues his own "commands."**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn explicitly questions whether the will of Théoden should prevail over the will of "Elendil’s heir." This is a moment of political theology. Aragorn is asserting his status as a peer (or superior) to the Lord of the Mark, using his "commands" to establish his rank publicly.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "treasonous arrogance."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about the "Sackville-Bagginses."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about the sword being "cursed."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the "metal vs diplomacy" contrast.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The condition of Théoden in his chair characterizes his initial state as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A spiritual and physical "atrophy" caused by the corrosive despair of Wormtongue’s whispering, where the King has become a prisoner within his own throne.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden’s "age" is not entirely natural; it is a manifestation of his psychological surrender. He is "bent" by the weight of the "twisted tales." His physical shrunkenness mirrors his shrunken horizons. The subsequent "resurrection" proves this was an unnatural state.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" that accepts his state as "noble aging."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "disguising height."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about "magical chairs."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about "physical injuries."

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Wormtongue’s rhetorical strategy is:**

**Correct Answer: B. Systematically isolating the King from external wisdom by framing all "outside" help as inherently parasitic and predatory, maintaining his own psychological monopoly.**

**Why this is correct:**
Wormtongue uses "Stormcrow" to link Gandalf with "ill-news." By defining Gandalf as a "carrion-fowl," he encourages the King to view his only true ally as a parasite. This is a classic tactic of gaslighting: keeping the victim dependent on the manipulator by discrediting outsiders.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" that accepts the " Stormcrow" label as a "historical account."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "shapeshifters."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "entertaining the court."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "Saruman’s orders."

### Question 6 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s use of his staff serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Visually and auditorily manifest the higher, divine authority he now represents, forcibly clearing the "shadows" of manipulation through an elemental unmasking.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf refuses to "bandy words." The thunder and lightning physically silence Wormtongue. It is an act of exorcism. By controlling light and sound, Gandalf reclaims the space for truth and forces Théoden to look toward the "shining sky."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "raw, dark magic."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "signaling the Ents."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" comparing him to "Sauron."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "stealing the King’s sword."

### Question 7 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Éowyn’s "cool pity" reveal her character as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A formidable, repressed spirit who possesses the pride of her lineage but is currently trapped by the "shadow" of her uncle’s despair and restrictive social roles.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éowyn is "stern as steel." Her "cool pity" shows her distance from the "bent" Théoden; she recognizes his weakness but is unable to act. Her reaction to Aragorn ("tall heir of kings") shows her hunger for a more heroic reality.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" calling her a "submissive servant."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about being a "secret ally of Wormtongue."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about "fading transparency."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "joining the Grey Company."

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s reaction upon casting aside his "prop" signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The spiritual "resurrection" of his true, heroic self, reclaiming his identity as a king of the "free days" once the psychological "black staff" is removed.**

**Why this is correct:**
Casting aside the staff is an act of liberation. The change in his eyes to "blue" indicates he has re-connected with the "world of light." He is no longer "walking on all fours" but is "new-awakened."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Lore-Trap" about "magical de-aging."
- **C** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "physical weight."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about being "enchanted by the wizard."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about "favorite props."

### Question 9 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s warning to Wormtongue emphasizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The vast ontological distance between his new "White" identity and the petty deceits of a "worm," where he no longer tolerates the "crooked" language of betrayal.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf the White addresses Wormtongue not as an equal but as a "witless worm." This highlights his new, angelic focus. He sees the "crooked" for what it is and bypasses it with the "lightning" of absolute truth.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "fighting Balrogs."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "losing Shire-politeness."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "destroying the hall."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "relative danger."

### Question 10 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The final image of Éowyn serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Symbolically identify her as the "shining" defender of Rohan’s domestic heart, while highlighting her isolation and her readiness for a more active, "silver" role.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éowyn is left to "lead" those who remain. Her posture is that of a sentinel. She "shines like silver," contrasting with the "darkness" of the house. This image emphasizes her tragedy: she is a warrior who must stay behind.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" calling her a "professional door-ward."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about being "forgotten."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "becoming the new King."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "keeping the peace."
