### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s self-deprecating thought that he is "just a piece of luggage for the Orcs" primarily reflects:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deep-seated feeling of inadequacy and existential crisis, where his lack of martial power in a time of war leads him to dehumanize himself into an object of "no good."**

**Why this is correct:**
Pippin explicitly asks "What good have I been?" and calls himself a "nuisance" and "luggage." His capture and bound state have stripped him of his sense of agency. By comparing himself to "luggage," he expresses the trauma of being an object moved by others' wills, illustrating the psychological impact of his perceived uselessness compared to heroes like Boromir or Strider.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text describes his thoughts as "ACHING" and himself as "cold and sick," and his wish that he had never come. These are signs of genuine distress and self-doubt, not lighthearted humor.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The conflict between Uglúk and Grishnákh over the "Halflings" reveals a fundamental tension between:**

**Correct Answer: B. The competing, and increasingly autonomous, political agendas of Isengard and Mordor, where the Orcs' loyalty is fragmented by the rivalries of their respective dark masters.**

**Why this is correct:**
Grishnákh represents "Lugbúrz" (Mordor) and the "Great Eye," while Uglúk is a "servant of Saruman the Wise" and the "White Hand." Their quarrel is not just personal; it is institutional. They follow different orders and serve different masters who are already competing for the Ring. This shows that the forces of evil are not a monolith, but a fragile coalition of competing tyrannies.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Uglúk is a proud servant of Saruman and shows absolute contempt for the "Whiteskins" (Rohirrim). His conflict with Grishnákh is an internal struggle for dominance within the dark forces.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s use of the "gollum, gollum" noise and his mention of "precious" to Grishnákh illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A brilliant and high-stakes psychological gambit, where Pippin exploits Grishnákh’s suspected greed and secret knowledge of the Ring to manipulate his captor into a potentially advantageous betrayal.**

**Why this is correct:**
Pippin "catches" Grishnákh's thought and realizes the Orc is looking for the Ring. By imitating Gollum, he provides Grishnákh with a "hook" to believe Pippin *has* the Ring. This manipulation leads Grishnákh to abduct the hobbits, inadvertently taking them outside the Orcish camp and providing the opportunity for their eventual escape during the Rohirrim's attack.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While the Orc-liquor makes him feel "hot," the text presents the "Gollum" noise as a calculated, "carefully chosen" tactic rather than a literal physical transformation.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Uglúk’s healing of Merry’s wound using "dark stuff out of a small wooden box" is characterized by the narrator as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A purely utilitarian and brutal restoration of a "commodity," where the efficiency of the cure is prioritized over the patient's comfort, leaving a permanent, physical mark of Orcish contact.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Orcs "clapped and hooted" as Merry "struggled wildly" against the "medicine." Uglúk's goal is not healing for the sake of well-being, but ensuring the "usefulness for the Master." The result is a "brown scar" that Merry bears "to the end of his days," a physical symbol of the harsh and dehumanizing nature of Orcish "care."

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text explicitly states that Uglúk was "not engaged in sport" and that kindness is "not even one of Uglúk's faults." He heals Merry only because he needs the prisoners "alive and as captured."

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s unbidden vision of "the keen face of Strider bending over a dark trail" functions as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A psychological anchor of hope and trust, where the memory of Strider’s expertise provides a necessary counter-narrative to the Orcs' "nightmare" of despair and captivity.**

**Why this is correct:**
In the midst of the "trampling" and "cursing," Pippin seeks comfort in the image of the "Ranger." It represents his belief in a world of skill, order, and loyalty that still exists outside his current "tunnel of misery." This mental image sustains his "wide-awake" wits and encourages him to leave the "token" of his brooch.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
There is no evidence of telepathy in the text; Pippin himself calls it a "vision... unbidden," which is a psychological manifestation of his hope rather than a literal communication.

---

### Question 6 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Orcs' running pace as "nightmare seconds of an endless time" emphasizes the:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological and physiological trauma of the captives, where the repetitive, agonizing motion of their captors dissolves their sense of normal time into a continuous, rhythmic experience of suffering.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "tough thick legs going up and down... like wire and horn" creates a mechanical, inhuman rhythm. For Pippin and Merry, the journey becomes a "long tunnel of misery" where "evil dreams and evil waking were blended." The description focuses on the *subjective* experience of the prisoners, for whom time has lost its meaning under the pressure of constant pain and exhaustion.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While they are having "black dreams," the "nightmare seconds" refer to their *waking* experience of being carried and forced to run, illustrating the horror of their reality rather than a transition to a new dream-state.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Grishnákh’s trembling arms and his "hiss" when the hobbits ask what he would give for the Ring reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. A consuming, private lust for the Ring that overrides his official "Orders," identifying him as a rogue agent whose individual ambition mirrors the corruptive power of the object he seeks.**

**Why this is correct:**
Grishnákh is "puzzled" but "trembling." He claims to be carrying out "Orders," but his decision to abduct the hobbits and have them "all to myself" proves his treachery. He is seduced by the possibility of the Ring, showing that Sauron's servants are just as vulnerable to its temptation as Boromir was, but with more overtly malicious intent.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Grishnákh's abduction of the hobbits is an act of *defiance* against Uglúk's authority, indicating that his desire for the Ring is stronger than his fear of his rival.

---

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Uglúk’s derision of the Northerners as "mountain-maggots" and "half-trained" highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The internal class and ethnic hierarchy within the Orcish forces, where the superior breeding and discipline of the "fighting Uruk-hai" is used to justify their dominance and contempt for lesser Orc breeds.**

**Why this is correct:**
Uglúk repeatedly emphasizes "We are the fighting Uruk-hai!" and mocks the "maggots and apes of Lugbúrz." This shows a highly structured and supremacist culture within Isengard's forces. Saruman has created a "master race" of Orcs who view all other goblin-kind as inferior fodder, further illustrating the fractured and hateful nature of the Enemy's armies.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Uglúk *does* leave them behind ("Off you go!"), but his motivation is his own survival and the fulfillment of his specific orders, rather than a planned sacrifice of his allies.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The imagery of the hobbits in the eaves of Fangorn, looking like "elf-children in the deeps of time," serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Re-humanize (or re-hobbitize) the captives after their dehumanizing ordeal, framing their survival as a return to an ancient, uncorrupted innocence that stands in contrast to the Orcish "burning."**

**Why this is correct:**
After being treated as "luggage," "cattle," and "vermin," the comparison to "elf-children" restores a sense of wonder and sacredness to the hobbits. It marks their entry into the "timeless" world of Fangorn and contrasts their "furtive" but beautiful figures with the "black wedge" of the Orcs and the "fire" of the battle.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The simile is used to describe their *appearance* and the *tonal quality* of the moment (peering out in wonder at the dawn), rather than to make a literal prophecy about their future status.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "sudden singing of many men" and the "great cry" of the Rohirrim as they charge at dawn primarily signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The arrival of a redemptive, solar-aligned human power that forcefully displaces the "nightmare" of the Orcs, restoring the "green earth" to the light of day through a communal and heroic ritual of war.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Rohirrim charge with the rising sun ("an arc of fire"). Their "singing" and "great cry" provide a sharp, heroic contrast to the "hissing," "snarling," and "screeching" of the Orcs. This moment represents the triumph of the "heroic age" human spirit—organized, vocal, and sun-lit—over the chaotic and light-hating malice of Mordor and Isengard.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The "singing" is described as part of their charge ("red light gleamed on mail and spear"), indicating it is a martial tradition that *increases* their energy and unity in battle, rather than a distraction from it.
