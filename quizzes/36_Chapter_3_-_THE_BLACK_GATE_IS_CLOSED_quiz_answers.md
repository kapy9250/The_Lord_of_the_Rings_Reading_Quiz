### Question 1 `[SCA/ACN]` `[Advanced]`

**The history of the "Teeth of Mordor," towers built by Gondor that are now "filled with sleepless eyes" of the Enemy, symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic irony of containment, where the very tools of defense built by the "Good" have been co-opted and perfected by the "Evil" to create an even more absolute state of surveillance.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that the towers were "built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power" to *prevent* Sauron's return. The fact that they are now "Teeth of Mordor" used *by* Sauron highlights the theme of the "long defeat" and the ways in which the works of the Wise can be "twisted to evil uses." It emphasizes the fragility of human victory and the tireless vigilance of the Shadow.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The tone of the passage is one of "despair," "dreadful day," and "ominous" echoes. The transition of the towers is presented as a somber historical tragedy rather than a humorous anecdote.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s thoughts of his Gaffer ("he'll miss his chance of _I told 'ee so_") while looking at the Black Gate primarily reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. A psychological grounding technique where the familiar, domestic "nagging" of home acts as a protective emotional buffer against the overwhelming, epic-scale despair of the Morannon.**

**Why this is correct:**
In the face of "the bitter end," Sam turns to the memory of the Gaffer. By imagining his father's predictable reaction, Sam reduces the cosmic horror of Mordor to a scale he can manage. This "Shire-mindedness" is Sam's primary defense; he maintains his identity by tethering his thoughts to the most mundane and "unimportant" details of his old life.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he misses his father, the focus of his thought is the *irony* of the Gaffer being right about his "bad end." It is a form of grim, domestic humor that helps him face the "lifeless ridges" of the Black Gate.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s statement—"I am commanded to go... and therefore I shall go"—marks a character state that is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A state of "higher" obedience where he has fully internalized the Quest as an absolute, categorical imperative that exists independently of the probability of success or survival.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is "filthy, haggard, and pinched," but he "cowers no longer." He recognizes that he is "commanded" (by the Council and by his own earlier choice). His resolve is no longer based on "hope" or "speed," but on a relentless adherence to his duty. He has reached a point of "categorical" commitment where the difficulty of the path no longer affects his decision to walk it.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he is tired, the text emphasizes his "resolute" and "clear" eyes. He is not acting out of a desire for rest, but out of a "commanded" purpose that has overcome his "fear and doubt."

### Question 4 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s distress at the thought of Frodo taking the Ring to the Black Gate ("Don't take the Precious to Him! ... Smeagol will keep it safe") reveals his primary fear to be:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate "loss" of his own chance to reclaim the Ring, combined with a visceral terror of the "He" (Sauron) who would consume both the object and its former bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum cries "He'll eat us all!" and begs Frodo to "give it back to little Smeagol." He views Sauron's possession of the Ring as a personal and universal annihilation. His "distress" is a mixture of his own "lust" for the Ring and his knowledge of the "cruel" and absolute nature of the Dark Lord who would never let it go.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gollum's primary concern is "the Precious." He wants to prevent "Him" from having it so that he might one day have it himself, rather than out of a selfless desire to protect the hobbits.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s warning to Gollum ("I should put on the Precious... and such would be my command") represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A cold, high-stakes realization of the "Mastery" inherent in the Ring, where Frodo consciously uses the threat of absolute spiritual enslavement to maintain control over a treacherous guide.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam is "startled" by Frodo's voice. Frodo is invoking the Ring's "bind[ing]" power to threaten Gollum. This shows Frodo's development—he is no longer just a "blindly kind" hobbit; he is using the "terrible" logic of the Ring to ensure the quest's continuation. It is a moment of "lordly" authority that foreshadows the moral risks he faces.

**Why C is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he is using the Ring's power, the text frames it as a "stern" necessity to control a "twisted" creature who just suggested stealing the Ring ("Give it back to Smeagol"). It is a defensive and tactical use of authority, rather than a slide into evil.

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s description of the "Tower of the Moon" (Minas Ithil) as a place where "very dreadful things live" and "nothing moves... that they don't know about" highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The spiritual corruption of a formerly "noble" place into an engine of active, malevolent surveillance, where the very stones have been "turned" to serve the Shadow.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo identifies the city as Minas Ithil, built by Isildur. Gollum notes it is "not nice now, not beautiful." The transition from a city of the "Moon" to a place of "Silent Watchers" mirrors the transition of the "Teeth of Mordor." It emphasizes how the Enemy colonizes and perverts the high human culture of the past to create his own system of absolute control.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gollum is actually *warning* them away from the city ("master must not go to the terrible city"), rather than trying to lure them in. He is offering the "other way" as a way to avoid the city's surveillance.

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "strange certainty" that Gollum is telling the truth about his escape from Mordor ("Gollum used _I_") suggests that Frodo has developed a:**

**Correct Answer: B. Sophisticated linguistic and psychological intuition, recognizing the use of the first-person singular as a rare eruption of the original, un-fragmented "Smeagol" identity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo has spent enough time with Gollum to recognize his speech patterns. The shift from the plural ("we," "us," "Smeagol") to the singular "I" indicates a moment of singular, personal honesty. This "linguistic" clue allows Frodo to trust Gollum's claim of escape, even when Aragorn and Sam are more suspicious. It shows Frodo's "keener" perception of Gollum's fractured soul.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Gollum is generally a "liar," and even here Frodo notes he is "plainly keeping a good deal back." Frodo's certainty is about this *one specific point* of truth, rather than a general belief in Gollum's honesty.

### Question 8 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The mention of the name "Cirith Ungol" as a "name of dreadful rumour" that Aragorn or Gandalf could have warned them about, underscores:**

**Correct Answer: B. The critical vulnerability of the hobbits' isolation, where the loss of their "Wise" guides has left them dangerously ignorant of the mythic-scale perils that are common knowledge to the Great.**

**Why this is correct:**
The narrator steps in to provide the name that the hobbits do not know. This emphasizes their "littleness" and their disconnection from the lore of the world. They are walking into a "dreadful rumour" without any armor or warning, highlighting the extreme risk of their "path unforeseen" and the catastrophic effect of the Fellowship's breaking.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While they *would* have been better informed, the text focuses on the *current* state of their isolation and the "treason" (Saruman's) that caused their lack of information, rather than suggesting they should have stayed behind.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s question about "oliphaunts" and his subsequent recitation of the Shire-rhyme in the middle of a war zone demonstrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The incredible durability of the Shire’s "small" culture, where childhood rhymes and domestic wonder provide a psychological sanctuary that can temporarily displace even the terror of Mordor.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam "forgets his fear" in his "eagerness for news." His recitation of the *Oliphaunt* rhyme is a defiant act of "Shire-talk." It proves that Sam's internal world is still populated by the "nonsense" and "tales" of his home, which provides him with a source of wonder that even the "Black Gate" cannot completely extinguish.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text presents this as a positive and even "noble" quality of the hobbit character. It is the very thing that "released [Frodo] from hesitation," showing that Sam's "childishness" is actually a vital source of emotional strength for the mission.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s laugh in response to the *Oliphaunt* rhyme and his subsequent decision ("Well, Smeagol, the third turn may turn the best") indicates that:**

**Correct Answer: B. The restorative power of "Shire-humor" and companionship, which provides the emotional release necessary to break a paralysis of despair and commit to a new, however perilous, path.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo had been "silent" and "bowed" in a "grey hollow" of despair. Sam's "nonsense" rhyme makes him laugh. This laughter "released him from hesitation." It highlights the essential role of Sam's "hobbitness" in Frodo's survival—Sam provides the "light" and the "laugh" that allow Frodo to make the "evil choice" and continue moving forward.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
If anything, the decision to follow Gollum into "Cirith Ungol" is a sign of his desperate situation *under* the Ring's pressure, but the *impetus* for making the decision is his emotional reconnection with Sam.
