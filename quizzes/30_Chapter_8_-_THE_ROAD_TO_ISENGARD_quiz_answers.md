### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s merry laugh when the Rohirrim gaze at the wood in wonder suggests that he:**

**Correct Answer: B. Finds a profound, joyful satisfaction in the "unforeseen" intervention of a primal power that has exceeded even his own strategic hopes, validating his faith in the "wild" world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf admits the trees' intervention is "a thing beyond the counsel of the wise." His laughter is not mockery, but delight in the proof that good exists in the world outside of his own "designs." It validates the theme that the "Free Peoples" have allies in nature that even Wizards cannot fully command or predict, providing a source of genuine "hope."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While they all mourn Boromir, Gandalf's laughter here is specifically directed at the "trees" and the "wizardry" they represent, marking a moment of celebratory victory in the wake of the battle.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Erkenbrand’s treatment of the defeated hillmen—setting them to work and requiring an oath rather than execution—marks a shift in:**

**Correct Answer: B. The re-establishment of a "just" human authority that recognizes the role of deception in the Enemy’s influence, choosing restorative justice and reconciliation over the brutal cycles of revenge promoted by Saruman.**

**Why this is correct:**
Erkenbrand tells the men of Dunland they were "deluded by Saruman." By showing them mercy ("you shall go free back to your land"), he breaks the "propaganda" Saruman used to incite them (that the Rohirrim burn captives). This act of mercy is a strategic and moral victory, reclaiming the "true" character of Rohan against the "crooked" influence of Isengard.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text says the hillmen are "enemies of Men" and have different customs ("burned their captives alive," they were told). Erkenbrand treats them as separate but human, rather than claiming a racial kinship.

### Question 3 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "creaking and groaning of boughs" and the "rumour of wordless voices" inside the mysterious wood convey:**

**Correct Answer: B. The intense, collective consciousness of the Huorns, whose presence is defined by a slow-burning, non-verbal rage that is focused specifically on the "orc-work" they have just avenged.**

**Why this is correct:**
Legolas notes a "great wrath" and that the air "throb[s]." The wood is not just trees; it is a manifestation of Fangorn's "long slow wrath." The "wordless voices" and "creaking" are the sounds of a sentient nature that has been "wantonly" hurt and is now expressing its collective, focused anger against the destroyers.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text specifies there was "no Orc or other living creature" and emphasizes the "wrath" and "murmuring angrily," characterizing the sounds as internal to the trees themselves rather than external environmental effects.

### Question 4 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s poetic description of the Caverns of Helm's Deep, comparing them to "folded marbles... translucent as the living hands of Queen Galadriel," reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. An aesthetic and spiritual awakening where the Dwarf’s "lithic" expertise is transformed into a high-order appreciation of natural beauty that rivals even the Elven-craft he previously admired.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli's speech is remarkably eloquent and moving ("It makes me weep to leave them"). He argues that Dwarves would "tend these glades of flowering stone, not quarry them." This shows a shift from a purely extractive/utilitarian view of the earth to a reverent, artistic stewardship. He is applying the "love and understanding" he learned from Galadriel to his own people's traditional domain.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Gimli explicitly denies this: "None of Durin's race would mine those caves... not if diamonds and gold could be got there." He is defending the intrinsic beauty of the caves against the "Men's" view of them as mere "holes."

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s remark to Théoden that "there are children in your land who... could pick the answer to your question" regarding the Ents suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. That the truth of the world is often preserved in "unimportant" folklore and children's stories, which the "Wise" and the powerful have foolishly discarded as they focused on more "modern" political realities.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf is critiquing the King's loss of historical and cultural memory. He points out that the answer was in the "twisted threads of story" all along. This highlights a recurring theme: true wisdom often resides in the "simple" or the "childlike," and the "Great" are often blind to the wonders that exist in their own backyard.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The issue isn't the language itself, but the *forgetting of the stories* that give meaning to the names (like "Entwood"). Théoden admits they are "forgetting them... as a careless custom."

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "black-winged birds" wheeling over the battlefield with "mournful cries" serve to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Underscore the grim reality of death and the "harvest" of war, where the natural world’s scavengers are the only ones to truly benefit from the conflict between Men and Orcs.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "carrion-fowl" are described as being "busy about the battle-field." Their "mournful cries" provide a stark, acoustic reminder of the cost of the victory. They represent the indifferent, biological cycle of life and death that continues regardless of the "heroic" narratives of the Kings.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Saruman uses birds as spies, the text here identifies them as "carrion-fowl" whose interest is the "slain," rather than reporting news. They are part of the natural aftermath of the battle.

### Question 7 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "moving towers of shadow" that pass the Company in the night, causing the "earth [to] shake," represent:**

**Correct Answer: B. The elemental, terrifying power of the returning Huorns, moving with a supernatural weight and silence that effectively "erases" the enemy from the land while asserting nature’s ultimate dominance.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "shadows" are the trees returning to Fangorn. The "shaking" earth and "groanings" show their immense, physical power. Their passage "between the mountain's arms" signifies the end of their temporary excursion into the world of Men. They have "revenged" themselves upon the Orcs, and their return to the "dark dales" marks the restoration of the forest's boundaries.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text says "no Orc remained alive" at the Hornburg, and the morning revealed that the "slain Orcs were gone, and the trees also," confirming the "shadows" were indeed the trees and their "shepherding."

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Ring of Isengard as a "graveyard of unquiet dead" with "plumes of vapour... lit from beneath with... venomous green" characterizes Saruman’s industry as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A morbid perversion of natural creation, where the earth has been "bored and delved" into a toxic, industrial hell-scape that reflects the spiritual decay of the wizard who created it.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "venomous" and "unquiet" imagery suggests that Saruman's works are inherently unhealthy and unnatural. The "graveyard" metaphor implies that his pursuit of power has turned a once "beautiful" valley into a place of death and "torment." It visualizes his "mind of metal and wheels" as a destructive force that ruins the earth.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text says "within living memory the men of Rohan had not passed its gates," and that Saruman's arts "came but from Mordor." His goal was power and a "child's model" of the Dark Tower, not tourism or public appeal.

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry and Pippin’s appearance on the "rubble-heap," feasting and smoking while "grey-clad, hardly to be seen," signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate "hobbitic" triumph—maintaining their core identity of comfort, leisure, and domestic peace even in the absolute center of a destroyed enemy stronghold, effectively "conquering" Isengard through their indifference to its former power.**

**Why this is correct:**
The hobbits are at "their ease" amid the "wreck of Isengard." Their focus on "plate and bottle" and "the weed" provides a comical but profound contrast to the "greatness" of the army that was just there. They have remained themselves despite the "nightmare," proving that the "small" values of the Shire are more enduring than the "metal and wheels" of the wizard.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
They were "hardly to be seen" because of their "elven-cloaks" and the "mist," which is a practical detail about their survival and concealment, rather than a magical transformation.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Merry’s "grave" welcome to the King ("Welcome, my lords, to Isengard! We are the doorwardens") carries a subtext of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A sophisticated, dry irony that uses the formal language of hospitality to highlight the total absurdity of the situation and the absolute deflation of Saruman’s former "Power" into a trapped and irrelevant figure.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry is playing the role of a "doorwarden" for a city whose doors have been "hurled and twisted on the ground." His "gravity" is a form of social comedy. By welcoming the King to a ruin, he highlights that the "Lord Saruman" is no longer a "Master" but a prisoner "closeted" with a traitor. It is a moment of rhetorical triumph for the "little people."

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The hobbits "bowed low" and the King calls them "dear friends" and "folk of legend." The interaction is one of mutual respect and amusement, rather than fear.
