### Question 1 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Celeborn’s offer to let the Company stay in Lorien ("those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here") serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Test the moral resolve of each member, ensuring that the final Company is composed only of those who choose the quest over personal safety.**

**Why this is correct:**
Celeborn presents a stark choice: "harden their hearts to leave" or "await the oncoming of the hour." This offer acts as a final filter. By allowing them a "refuge" in Lorien, he ensures that their continued participation in the quest is a voluntary act of will, rather than a forced obligation. This confirms the internal strength of the group before they enter the "doom" ahead.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Celeborn warns that even those who stay "may return to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle," showing that the Elves *are* committed to the war and realize that nowhere is truly safe.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s hard look at Boromir during their final night in the pavilion reveals his growing awareness of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The corrosive, internal "debate" within Boromir, where his desire for the Ring as a weapon is beginning to overcome his conscious loyalty to the Company.**

**Why this is correct:**
Boromir's slip of the tongue ("folly to throw away—") and his "strange... glance" signal his shifting state of mind. Frodo, whose perception has been "sharpened" by the Ring and his wound, detects the subtext of Boromir's words. This moment establishes the growing tension and the psychological threat that Boromir now poses to the quest's primary objective (destroying the Ring).

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Boromir is not a "friend" of the Black Riders; he is a man of Gondor who is being tempted by the *Ring itself* out of a desire to save his city. His "evil" is one of corrupted good (ambition), not a simple alliance with the enemy.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Elves' description of *lembas* ("more strengthening than any food made by Men... more pleasant than _cram_") characterizes Elven work as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A synthesis of physical nourishment and spiritual sustenance, reflecting a high-level "craft" that infuses material objects with moral and biological potency.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Elves explain that *lembas* is given to serve "when all else fails." It is more than just food; it's a "blessing" in material form. The specific instructions to "eat little" and "only at need" mark it as a sacred or high-order substance that provides the "vigour" necessary for a mythic task, distinguishing Elven "making" from the purely utilitarian "cram" of Men.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The Elves' intent is entirely benevolent ("kindly hosts"). They are providing necessary survival tools for a "perilous" journey, not using food as a form of cultural manipulation.

### Question 4 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The shifting colors of the Elven-cloaks ("grey with the hue of twilight... green as shadowed leaves... brown as fallow fields") symbolize:**

**Correct Answer: B. The profound harmony between Elven craft and the natural world, allowing the wearer to become a literal extension of the landscape’s own shifting moods and textures.**

**Why this is correct:**
The cloaks are described as having the "hue and beauty of all these things" (leaf, branch, water, stone). This reflects the Elvish philosophy mentioned by the leader: they "put the thought of all that we love into all that we make." The cloaks are a manifestation of the Elves' deep integration with nature, providing protection through "concealment" rather than "armour."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While the cloaks help the wearer keep "out of the sight of unfriendly eyes," the text attributes this to their "hue and beauty" and their ability to blend into the environment, rather than a magical alteration of the wearer's physical size.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s feeling of comfort at the "gift of boats" primarily stems from:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological "respite" from the burden of leadership, allowing him to delay a painful choice between his personal destiny in Gondor and his duty to Frodo.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn is "divided in his mind" between going to Minas Tirith with Boromir and following Frodo into Mordor. The boats provide a way to "float down the broad tide" without having to make an immediate decision on which "shore" to take. The river provides a temporary, neutral path that postpones the final, agonizing moment of the Company's breaking.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While water travel might be safer, the text explicitly links Aragorn's "comfort" to the fact that there would "now be no need to decide his course for some days."

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Galadriel’s gift to Aragorn—the Elessar stone and the name foretold for him—marks his transition from:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "hunted man" in hiding to an overtly recognized and spiritually validated claimant to the throne, whose royal identity is now physically manifested.**

**Why this is correct:**
Galadriel tells him to "take the name that was foretold for you." The green stone (the Elessar) is a literal "Elfstone," a royal heirloom. When he puts it on, he seems "tall and kingly" and years of "toil" fall from him. This is his "coronation" in spirit, moving him from the "Strider" persona toward his ultimate identity as the King of the West.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
He is already an "Elf-friend." The transition is specifically from a secret, burdened Ranger to a public and visionary King of *Men*, recognized by the highest Elven authority.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s request for a "single strand of your hair" and Galadriel’s reaction reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. A revolutionary shift in Dwarf-Elf relations, where Gimli’s poetic and reverent "boldness" replaces ancient racial enmity with a bond of aesthetic and moral devotion.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli asks for something personal and beautiful, rather than "gold and jewels." This "bold yet courteous" request shocks the other Elves but wins Galadriel's smile. It proves her earlier defense of him correct: Gimli has a "tongue" and a "heart" that can appreciate Elven beauty, marking the end of the "estrangement" between the two peoples within the Company.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While deeply emotional, the text frames it as a moment of mutual respect and "good will," rather than a romantic interest. Gimli's desire is to "treasure" the memory of her "gentle words" and create a "pledge" between their houses.

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s perception of Galadriel during the parting feast—no longer "perilous or terrible" but a "living vision of that which has already been left far behind"—suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound, melancholic recognition of the Elves' transience and the inevitable "fading" of their world as the quest enters its final, more "mortal" stage.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo sees her through the lens of "later days," as a "living vision" of a world that is already "left far behind." This captures the "bitter-sweet" quality of Lorien—it is a place of unfallen beauty that is nonetheless "doomed" to vanish. Frodo is perceiving the "long defeat" that Galadriel previously mentioned, identifying her as a historical rather than just a contemporary figure.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Galadriel has not lost her magic; she is *choosing* to "diminish" because the time of the Elves is over. Her change in Frodo's eyes is a result of his own "keener" sight and his understanding of her "fate."

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The imagery of Lothlórien "slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees" as the Company departs, creates a tone of:**

**Correct Answer: B. Profound ontological loss and isolation, where the sanctuary of the mythic past is physically receding, leaving the protagonists in a "grey and leafless" present.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "slipping backward" and the "forgotten shores" metaphors emphasize that Lorien is a world apart. As they move into the Great River, the hobbits feel "helpless" and "grey." This imagery reinforces the theme that Lorien is a fragile island of the past, and its disappearance from view marks the Company’s final entry into the "leafless" and dangerous reality of the current age.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text says the travellers "sat still without moving or speaking" and that the music "did not comfort him." The departure is presented as a moment of intense sadness and "dazzled" tears, not relief.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s lament that he has "taken my worst wound in this parting" primarily highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological and spiritual "wound" of beauty and love, which is more painful than physical torture because its loss creates an unfillable void in the heart.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli contrasts the "torment in the dark" (physical pain) with the "danger of light and joy." He realizes that loving and then losing something truly fair (Galadriel and Lorien) is a more profound suffering than any Orcish blade could inflict. This "wound" is the price of his moral and aesthetic awakening in the Golden Wood.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The narrative presents Gimli's sensitivity as a sign of his unique and noble character ("I count you blessed," says Legolas), rather than a weakness. His ability to weep "openly" is a hallmark of his transformation from a "grasping" Dwarf to an "Elf-friend."
