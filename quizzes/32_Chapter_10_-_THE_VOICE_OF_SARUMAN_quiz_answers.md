### Question 1 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Saruman’s voice as an "enchantment" that makes all he says seem "wise and reasonable" identifies his primary power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A sophisticated form of psychological and rhetorical manipulation that exploits the listener’s own desire for intellectual and moral validation, creating a false sense of shared wisdom.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text explains that those who heard the voice "remembered only that it was a delight... and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves." Saruman's power is not a blunt mental takeover, but a seductive persuasion that makes the victim *want* to agree with him to feel intellectually superior or "reasonable." It is a form of spiritual narcissism that he weaponizes.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text distinguishes between "command" and "pleas," and notes that the spell could be rejected with an "effort of mind and will." It is a psychological trap rather than a total physical coercion.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Saruman’s greeting to Théoden ("O worthy son of Thengel the Thrice-renowned!") is most likely intended to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Use flattery and the language of historical continuity to re-establish a "friendship" that allows him to resume his psychological dominance over the King.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman uses high-flown, archaic titles ("Thrice-renowned") to appeal to Théoden's pride and his sense of lineage. By framing his former actions as a desire to "save" the King from "evil counsels," he attempts to rewrite history and position himself once again as the "wise mentor" who alone can deliver Rohan from its troubles.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Saruman is knowledgeable, his use of history here is a tactical tool for manipulation rather than a genuine scholarly pursuit. He is "acting" the part of a kindly elder.

---

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Riders’ reaction to Saruman’s speech—feeling that Gandalf’s dealings had been "rough and proud"—demonstrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The effectiveness of Saruman’s "Voice" in distorting memory and perception, turning the honest directness of an ally into an appearance of arrogance.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that "over their hearts crept a shadow" and they felt "spell-bound." Saruman’s voice makes Gandalf’s necessary, blunt truths seem like "roughness." This shows how the "Voice" can isolate a target by making their true friends seem like oppressors, while the enemy presents himself as a "door of escape."

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The Riders *are* loyal, but they are currently "spell-bound." Their reaction is a result of Saruman's magical influence on their perception rather than a permanent character flaw or a conscious choice to be disloyal.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s interruption ("In the language of Orthanc help means ruin, and saving means slaying") serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Provide a needed "lithic" and grounded reality check that punctures Saruman’s rhetorical enchantment through blunt, literal translation of his true actions.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli, the Dwarf, represents a more grounded and literal perspective. He uses the "language of Orthanc" metaphor to expose Saruman's newspeak. By defining the wizard's words through his *deeds* (the ruin of the land), Gimli breaks the "enchantment" for the others, providing a moment of clarity that prevents the King from falling back into the trap.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gimli is described as "growl[ing]" and "gripping the handle of his axe." He is not "immune"; he is *actively resisting* the spell through a conscious act of cynical translation and will.

---

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Saruman’s dismissal of Éomer as a "young serpent" with a "poisoned tongue" reveals his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Hypocritical projection of his own nature onto his opponent, combined with a loss of self-control when his "honey" is challenged by an uncomfortable truth.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman is the one with the "poisoned tongue" (as established by the name Wormtongue). When Éomer identifies him as an "old liar," Saruman’s "suave" mask slips and helashes out with the same insults he himself deserves. This "flash of his anger" shows that Saruman's sophistication is a fragile facade that cracks when he is confronted with his own failures and crimes.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Saruman's tone is one of pure "sneer" and "angry" dismissal. He is trying to silence Éomer by characterizing him as an ignorant "soldier" who should "be content" with killing Orcs.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s final rejection of Saruman, mentioning the "torches in Westfold" and the "hewed Hama's body," indicates that his kingship is now founded on:**

**Correct Answer: B. A concrete, lived morality that prioritizes the protection of his people and the sanctity of the dead over the abstract "peace" and "aid" offered by a traitor.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden rejects Saruman's "politic" peace. He demands a reckoning for the literal, physical suffering of his subjects ("children that lie dead"). His kingship has moved from the "shadow" of abstract despair back into the reality of his duty as a protector. He identifies Saruman as a "finger of the claw of Mordor," showing he now sees the moral core of the conflict clearly.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he mentions the "gibbet," his primary focus is on the "justice" of his defense and the "injury" done to his land. He is rejecting a false peace, not just seeking a personal vendetta.

---

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s offer to let Saruman go "free" to Mordor is a form of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme irony and a demonstration of Saruman’s "unmasking," showing that without his staff and tower, the only place left for him is the very tyranny he foolishly tried to rival.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf exposes the reality of Saruman's position. Having "cheated [his] new master," Saruman has no allies left. The offer of "freedom" to go to Mordor is a reminder that Saruman's only possible destination is his own destruction at the hands of the Dark Lord. It emphasizes that Saruman's "Cunning Mind" has led him into an absolute dead end.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gandalf already knows Saruman does not have the Ring (otherwise he wouldn't have been hiding in the tower). The parley is a final offer of "mercy" and a public demonstration of Saruman's fall.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Saruman’s "shrunken" and "lined" face as he returns to the rail against his will reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total erosion of his "Power" and his loss of autonomy before the superior, returned authority of Gandalf the White, who now commands the very order Saruman betrayed.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman returns "as if dragged against his will." This physical surrender proves that Gandalf now holds the true authority. Saruman's "shrunken" appearance is the visual reality of his diminished state—he is no longer the "Master" but a "fool" who has been "cast... from the order." His power was a mask that has now been forcibly removed.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The staff is a symbol of his office; his difficulty in holding it is a result of his spiritual collapse and Gandalf's command, not a physical weight issue.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The throwing of the "dark globe" (the Palantír) by Wormtongue represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, self-destructive irony of hatred, where a frantic act of spite (directed at either Gandalf or Saruman) inadvertently delivers one of the enemy’s most precious and dangerous tools into the hands of the Company.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn notes that Wormtongue "could not make up his mind which he hated more." The Palantír is a "treasure" that Saruman would never have chosen to cast away. By throwing it in a moment of pure, unthinking malice, Wormtongue unwittingly assists the very "cut-throats" he was trying to kill, illustrating how hatred "hurts itself" and aids the "good."

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While it was a "parting shot," its primary *narrative* significance is the "strange turn of fortune" that puts a powerful artifact into Gandalf's hands, rather than its (failed) success as a weapon.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s conclusion that Saruman is an "unhappy fool" who still "dreams of riding the storm" characterizes the wizard’s tragedy as:**

**Correct Answer: B. The inevitable self-entrapment of a high intellect that has lost its moral center, becoming so consumed by its own "Cunning Mind" that it can no longer see the reality of its own impending destruction.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman "will not serve, only command." Even in total defeat, he clings to the "power of Orthanc." His tragedy is the inability to admit fault or accept help. He is a "fool" because he continues to play a game he has already lost, blinded by his own pride and his desire for "Mastery" to the very end.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gandalf has *already* replaced him as the "White" (as he told the others earlier). His grief here is for the "good [that] now festers in the tower," showing his regret for the loss of a peer rather than a personal ambition.
