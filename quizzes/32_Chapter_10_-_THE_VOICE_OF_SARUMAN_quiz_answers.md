### Question 1 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Saruman’s voice as an "enchantment" identifies his primary power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A sophisticated form of psychological and rhetorical manipulation that exploits the listener’s own desire for intellectual validation, creating a false sense of "shared wisdom."**

**Why this is correct:**
The text states that "desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves." Saruman’s power is not a brute-force spell, but a subtle "seduction" of the intellect. He makes the listener feel that to agree with him is to be "wise" and "just," making the rejection of his voice an act of "mind and will."

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Saruman’s greeting to Théoden is intended to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Use archaic flattery to re-establish a "mentorship" dynamic, attempting to resume his psychological dominance over the King.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman uses the formal, respectful names of Théoden’s ancestors. This is a tactical move to "re-bind" the King to the old relationship of "Counsel." By acting like a concerned friend, Saruman tries to overwrite his recent acts of war, attempting to pull Théoden back into the "shadow" of his influence.

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Riders’ reaction to Saruman’s speech demonstrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The effectiveness of the "Voice" in distorting memory and perception, recasting honest directness as arrogance while framing betrayal as "fairness."**

**Why this is correct:**
The Riders feel Gandalf was "rough and proud." This is a complete inversion of reality. Saruman’s voice has the power to "wash out" the memory of his own Orcish slaughter and replace it with a feeling that Gandalf is the true obstacle to "peace." It shows how vulnerable the "un-Wise" are to sophisticated rhetoric.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s interruption serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Provide a grounded, "lithic" reality check that punctures the rhetorical enchantment through blunt, literal translation of Saruman's deeds.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli says the words "stand on their heads." As a Dwarf who values the "hard" truth of stone, he rejects the "honey" of the voice. His bluntness ("help means ruin") acts as a spiritual "anchor" for the Company, using the physical memory of Saruman's violence to break the spell of his speech.

---

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Saruman’s dismissal of Éomer reveals his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Hypocritical projection of his own nature onto his opponent, combined with a loss of self-control when his "honey" is challenged by a blunt truth.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman calls Éomer a "young serpent" with a "poisoned tongue." This is exactly what Saruman is. When his flattery fails to move the "unlearned" warriors, his "Voice" slips into its true form: spite and arrogance. This "cracked" moment allows the others to see the "beggar" beneath the "Lord."

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s final rejection of Saruman indicates that his kingship is founded on:**

**Correct Answer: B. A concrete, lived morality that prioritizes the protection of his people and the sanctity of the dead over abstract "peace" and "alliance."**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden mentions the "torches in Westfold" and the "dead children." This is the ultimate "High" response. He rejects Saruman's offer of "alliance" because he cannot trade the lives of his people for a strategic convenience. His kingship is rooted in the "blood and earth" of Rohan, rather than the "metal and wheels" of Isengard.

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s offer to let Saruman go "free" is a form of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme irony and a total "unmasking," showing that without his staff and tower, the only place left for a traitor is the very tyranny he foolishly tried to rival.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf offers him the choice: "serve" or be "devoured" by the East. This exposes the futility of Saruman's ambition. He tried to be a "Master," but he is now revealed as an "unhappy fool" whose only future is as a slave to Sauron. The "freedom" Gandalf offers is the freedom to see his own total failure.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Saruman’s "shrunken" and "lined" face reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total erosion of his "Power" and his loss of autonomy before the superior authority of Gandalf the White, who now commands the order Saruman betrayed.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman is "dragged" to the rail. His physical appearance now matches his internal spiritual state: he is "withered." This visual change marks the transition of authority. Gandalf the White has effectively "absorbed" the rightful power of the office, leaving Saruman as a "shrivelled" shell of his former self.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The throwing of the Palantír represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The self-destructive irony of hatred, where a frantic act of spite inadvertently delivers one of the Enemy’s most dangerous tools into the hands of the Company.**

**Why this is correct:**
Whether thrown by Saruman (in rage) or Wormtongue (in spite), the act is "foolish." It is a "parting shot" that backfires. By trying to "hurt" Gandalf with a heavy object, they give him the "Key of Orthanc." This reinforces the theme: "oft evil will shall evil mar."

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s conclusion that Saruman is an "unhappy fool" characterizes the wizard’s tragedy as:**

**Correct Answer: B. The inevitable self-entrapment of a high intellect that has lost its moral center, becoming so consumed by its own "Cunning" that it cannot see the reality of its own destruction.**

**Why this is correct:**
Saruman "dreams of riding the storm." Even in total defeat, he clings to his pride. His tragedy is the inability to accept "pity" or "pardon." He is trapped in the "tower" of his own ego, preferring to be a "prisoner" of his own making rather than a "servant" of the West.
