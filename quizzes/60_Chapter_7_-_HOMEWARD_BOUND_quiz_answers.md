### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s reluctance to ride into the Ford of Bruinen and his thought—"There is no real going back... I shall not be the same"—conveys:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound ontological "exile," where the spiritual and physical wounding of the quest has permanently separated him from the unfallen world of his origin, making "home" an illusory or unattainable concept.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo explicitly states, "I shall not be the same." The anniversary of his Morgul-wound (Oct 6) causes a recurrence of "pain and unease." This shows that he is no longer a "whole" citizen of the Shire. He has been "drawn" too far into the Unseen world. His reluctance at the Ford marks his recognition that he is returning to his homeland as a "stranger" who can never fully re-integrate into its former peace.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
His halt is described as a result of "ill at ease" and "memory of darkness" (the Black Riders at the Ford), rather than a lack of physical skill.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the weather turning "wild and wet" as they approach Bree, with a "great curtain of rain" veiling the hill, serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Tonalize the "shrunken" and dismal reality of the northern lands compared to the glory of the South, using the "bare" and "wet" environment to mirror the decay and "ruffianly" atmosphere the hobbits are about to encounter.**

**Why this is correct:**
The shift from the "fair woodlands" to the "bare boughs" and "curtain of rain" reflects the transition from the celebratory atmosphere of Gondor back to the "troubled" reality of the North. The rain "veils" Bree-hill, signaling that their homecoming will be marked by confusion and isolation rather than a clear or joyful welcome.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone is one of "sinking hearts" and "chill," emphasizing the unsettling nature of the arrival rather than providing a humorous contrast.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Gate-keeper’s use of a "great cudgel" and his look of "fear and suspicion" indicate that:**

**Correct Answer: B. The breakdown of civil order and the loss of the "open-hearted" security of the past, where the once-friendly village has been forced into a state of paranoid, defensive isolation due to internal and external threats.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Gate-keeper "scowled" and was "brightened" only when he saw Gandalf. This illustrates how much Bree has changed. The "open" village of Book 1, which welcomed strangers, has become a place of "watchers all round the fence." This characterizes the "Shadow" as a social poison that destroys communal trust and replaces it with physical weapons like the "cudgel."

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While they *are* wearing "strange gear" (bright mail and helms), the text attributes the Gate-keeper's behavior to the "bad trouble" and "robbers" in the area, rather than a specific misidentification of the hobbits.

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Barliman Butterbur’s "wonder and delight" upon recognizing the hobbits, followed by his "wrinkled and careworn" face, reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological strain of maintaining a "brave face" in a dying business, where the momentary joy of seeing friends is immediately suppressed by the crushing daily reality of fear and "bad trouble."**

**Why this is correct:**
Butterbur tries to maintain his "old breathless bustle," but the reality of the "empty rooms" and "low murmur" in the Common Room contradicts it. His wrinkled face shows the toll of the "disturbing" year. He is a man struggling to remain a hospitable host in a world that has become "downright bad," illustrating the cost of the war on the simple folk of the border-lands.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Butterbur explicitly mentions he was "full of my own troubles," which drove out other thoughts. His "careworn" state is a result of the *excess* of immediate worry rather than a general loss of cognitive function.

---

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Butterbur’s observation that "we don't want no outsiders at Bree... We want to be let alone" illustrates a philosophy of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A defensive, isolationist parochialism that rejects the "High" political restoration of the King in favor of a narrow, local desire for a returned (and perhaps impossible) state of "un-disturbed" obscurity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Butterbur is "dubious" about the King's return. He fears "a whole crowd o' strangers" coming to his land. This represents the "Low" human perspective: he values his local autonomy and peace more than the "Great" restoration. He doesn't want Gondor's "glory"; he just wants to be "let alone" to run his inn, showing the gap between royal destiny and common necessity.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Butterbur is described as being "in comfort" since Gandalf's last visit and he eventually welcomes the news of the King once he realizes it means "better times for Bree." His initial reaction is one of protective localism rather than political treachery.

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Butterbur’s reaction to learning that Strider is now the King—his mouth opening wide and his gasp of "Strider!"—characterizes his understanding of power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A comical and fundamentally "lowly" disbelief, where the transformation of a "mud-caked" vagabond into a mythic sovereign is so outside his world-order that it feels like a breakdown of reality itself ("what are we coming to?").**

**Why this is correct:**
Butterbur’s "study in wonder" highlights the incredible nature of Aragorn's arc. For Butterbur, Strider was a "Ranger" who didn't even use a bed. The idea of him with a "crown and all and a golden cup" is an absurdity. This reaction provides a "bottom-up" view of the King's restoration, emphasizing how the "un-glamorous" reality of the Ranger's life makes his royal return more miraculous to those who knew him.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
On the contrary, the "golden cup" and "crown" are to Butterbur the ultimate symbols of an unreachably "High" and alien world, causing him to gasp in disbelief at the idea of Strider possessing them.

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "hush" that falls in the Common Room when a song is called for suggests that the people of Bree:**

**Correct Answer: B. Are suffering from a collective trauma where the memory of "uncanny" events (Frodo’s disappearance) has turned communal entertainment into a source of fear rather than joy, marking the end of the inn's former lightheartedness.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that the youth was "frowned down" and the call "was not repeated." The "uncanny events" at the inn (the "vanishing trick") and the subsequent "killings" have destroyed the social ease of Bree. Song is no longer a safe or happy act; it has become a reminder of the "dreadful things" that happen when the "outside" world enters the room.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
They were in a "merrier mood" than they had been for a year because of the hobbits' return, but the *specific* act of public singing is rejected because of its association with the "uncanny," indicating a localized psychological scar rather than a total loss of interest in joy.

### Question 8 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s statement to the hobbits—"You must settle its [the Shire's] affairs yourselves; that is what you have been trained for"—redefines the Quest as:**

**Correct Answer: B. An apprenticeship in "High" responsibility, where the epic journey was not just a mission to destroy an object, but a rigorous moral and practical education intended to prepare the hobbits for the difficult task of self-governance.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf tells them "You are grown up now." He rejects the role of "setting things to rights" for them. This identifies the hobbits' journey as a "coming of age" for their entire race. By facing Sauron and the Nazgûl, they have earned the internal strength and wisdom to deal with the "small and mean" mischief of the Shire on their own. The Quest was their "training" for citizenship and leadership.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While they have "grown very high" in spirit and renown, Gandalf’s point is that they no longer *need* a wizard's help, rather than a literal comparison of magical potency.

### Question 9 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s decision to have a "long talk with Bombadil"—characterizing himself as a "stone doomed to rolling" and Tom as a "moss-gatherer"—identifies his retirement as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A return to a state of pure contemplation and "un-hasty" existence, seeking communion with the only other being who remained "untroubled" and stationary throughout the catastrophic movement of the Age.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf's mission as a "mover" and "enemy of Sauron" is finished. By choosing Bombadil as his final companion, he seeks out the one entity who is "not interested" in his deeds. This represents a desire for a "peace" that is entirely disconnected from the war. It marks Gandalf's transition from a political and military agent back into a "pilgrim" of the spirit.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
On the contrary, his desire for a "talk" with the "Eldest" shows he is *deepening* his engagement with the most fundamental and "High" lore of Middle-earth as he prepares to depart from it.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The contrast between Merry’s feeling that the journey is a "dream that has slowly faded" and Frodo’s feeling that it is "falling asleep again" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The fundamental difference in their recovery: Merry views the return to normalcy as a positive awakening, while Frodo experiences the mundane world as an "unreal" or suffocating state compared to the "sharp" reality of his spiritual ordeal.**

**Why this is correct:**
For Merry, the war was a series of events that are now over ("faded"). For Frodo, the peace of the Shire feels like "falling asleep"—a state of reduced awareness. This highlights Frodo's permanent "thinning." He has been "wakened" by the Ring to a level of perception that makes the comfortable, "simple" life of a hobbit feel like a loss of consciousness. It is a sign of his impending departure.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The entire chapter is filled with their specific memories and guesses about the Shire, proving they remember their journey very well. Their different metaphors describe their *emotional and spiritual relationship* to their memories, not a lack of them.
