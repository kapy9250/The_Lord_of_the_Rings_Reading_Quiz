### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s envy of Sam’s role as Frodo's companion, despite the "hopeless journey," primarily reflects:**

**Correct Answer: B. The powerful bond of kinship and the idea that social exclusion from one's friends is a more painful "punishment" than shared physical hardship.**

**Why this is correct:**
Merry and Pippin make it clear: "We are envying Sam, not you [Frodo]." For them, being left behind in the "safety" of Rivendell while their friends face "stiff times" is the true punishment. This illustrates the core value of "friendship" over "great wisdom" that Gandalf later cites—their desire to go is rooted in personal loyalty and the refusal to be separated, even by death.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While Elrond says they don't "understand," their motivation is specifically described as a desire to "stick together," showing they value the *relational* reality more than the *tactical* danger.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "red star" that Frodo observes from his window, which glares "like a watchful eye," functions as a symbol of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The growing spiritual and physical reach of Sauron’s malice, which is beginning to penetrate even the atmospheric peace of Rivendell.**

**Why this is correct:**
The red star is described as a "watchful eye that glared above the trees." This is a clear symbolic link to the Eye of Sauron. Its appearance in the sky over Rivendell, growing "brighter and brighter" as the Moon wanes, signifies that the "Shadow" is intensifying and that even the Elven-sanctuary is under observation.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While the color red is associated with war, the specific description ("watchful eye," "glared") creates a direct thematic connection to the Dark Lord’s primary sigil and his active search for the Ring.

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s support for Pippin’s inclusion in the Company ("trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom") suggests that he believes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The spiritual strength of loyalty and mutual devotion may be a more effective weapon against the Shadow than the calculated power of Elf-lords.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf explicitly states that even an Elf-lord like Glorfindel "could not storm the Dark Tower." He argues that in a quest based on "secrecy" and "the weak," the "friendship" of the hobbits is a more appropriate and perhaps more resilient force. This reinforces the theme that moral qualities are more significant than raw power in the face of Sauron.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gandalf doesn't say wisdom is "useless," but that in *this specific matter*, the "unforeseen" quality of friendship is a better guide than the "great wisdom" that would traditionally choose more powerful warriors.

### Question 4 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Bilbo’s insistence that Frodo wear the mithril-coat "under your outer clothes" and "Don't tell anybody else!" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Establish a layer of hidden, ancestral protection that allows Frodo to maintain the "plain hobbit" appearance while possessing a "fined" and noble inner resilience.**

**Why this is correct:**
Bilbo tells him "Just a plain hobbit you look... But there is more about you now than appears on the surface." The mithril-coat is a physical manifestation of Frodo’s hidden nobility and the "inheritance" of Bilbo’s success. By keeping it secret, the narrative preserves Frodo’s status as the "small" and "weak" protagonist while providing him with a "fair" and nearly impenetrable defense.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While it provides tactical protection, the "secret" nature of it is primarily about the *discrepancy between appearance and reality*—a core theme of the book (as seen in the poem about Strider).

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Bilbo’s song ("I sit beside the fire and think") primarily conveys a tone of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A poignant, autumnal acceptance of his own mortality and the continuation of the world’s beauty through others after his own "winter" arrives.**

**Why this is correct:**
Bilbo thinks of "people who will see a world / that I shall never know." The song expresses a peaceful resignation to the fact that his "part is ended" and that he is now a listener for "returning feet." It captures the "autumnal" spirit of his character in Rivendell—full of memory and "quiet delight" rather than active ambition.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he "almost wishes" his adventures were not over, the song itself is focused on "thinking" and "listening," representing a deeper level of acceptance and peace than "bitter regret."

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Boromir’s insistence on blowing his horn at the setting forth ("I will not go forth as a thief in the night") highlights his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Commitment to a traditional, heroic martial ethic that values overt challenge and pride over the Ranger’s necessary "secrecy" and "stealth."**

**Why this is correct:**
Boromir's horn-blast is a gesture of "pride and dignity." He rejects the idea of being a "thief," viewing the quest through the lens of Gondor’s overt warfare. This sets him in immediate ideological contrast with Elrond and Aragorn, who understand that "secrecy" is their only hope. Boromir’s refusal to "hide" signals his future struggle with the Ring's power.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
It is not a personal rebellion against Gandalf, but a fundamental difference in *cultural* values—the "stalwart tower" of Gondor vs. the "secret" watch of the Rangers.

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s silence and restlessness in Hollin, and his observation that "now all things but you are silent," indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A heightened, sensory-based intuition that detects the "unnatural" silence caused by active, malevolent surveillance (the spies of the Enemy).**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn’s "miss[ing] something" is his realization that the birds and creatures have been silenced or driven away by the presence of "watchfulness." As a Ranger, he reads the *absence* of sound as a sign of danger. This confirms that the Company is being tracked long before the *crebain* are actually seen.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
His restlessness is described as a "sense of watchfulness, and of fear," indicating an external, strategic concern rather than a personal annoyance with his companions.

---

### Question 8 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Caradhras as "the Cruel" with "sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Personify the natural landscape as a sentient, ancient, and hostile entity that possesses its own inherent malice, independent of Sauron’s direct control.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn notes that there are "evil and unfriendly things... that are not in league with Sauron, but have purposes of their own." The "blood-stained" look and the "shrill cries" of the wind characterize Caradhras as an active antagonist. This expands the threat-level of the journey beyond just the "Dark Lord" to include the primordial, untamed forces of the world itself.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The description provides *tone* and *character* to the mountain; the snow itself is the "weapon," but the "dull red" and "ill name" are what establish the mountain's *personality* as "the Cruel."

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s dream of Bilbo criticizing his diary ("Snowstorms on January the twelfth...") reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological "tug" of the Shire and Bilbo’s domestic comfort, which manifests as a gentle, ironic internal voice even as Frodo faces death by freezing.**

**Why this is correct:**
In his "hazy dream," Frodo hears the voice of home. The irony of Bilbo's remark (complaining about the weather in a diary) provides a sharp contrast to the mortal peril of the blizzard. It shows that even in his final extremities, Frodo's mind seeks the safety and "joking" perspective of the Shire, which acts as a protective psychological buffer.

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The dream is described as "warm and hazy" and the voice as Bilbo's, suggesting a comforting memory rather than a manifestation of "fear" or inadequacy.

---

### Question 10 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "victory" of Caradhras over the Company—forcing them to retreat and "stumble wearily down the slope"—illustrates that:**

**Correct Answer: B. Even with "great wisdom" and "doughty Men," the Company is subject to the overwhelming, indifferent forces of the ancient world, forcing them onto a more "perilous" and "secret" road.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf admits he "cannot burn snow." The "defeat" by Caradhras proves that the Company's path is not just a matter of will or strength; they are constantly being "deemed" and "headed off" by the world itself. This failure is the narrative trigger that forces them into the "other way"—Moria—which both Gandalf and Aragorn had hoped to avoid.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text makes it clear that the quest *cannot* be delayed ("the Shadow... draws nigh"), and the storm is presented as an act of specific "malice" rather than just a seasonal inconvenience.
