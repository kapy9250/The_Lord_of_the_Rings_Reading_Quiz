### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The conversation about stone-work and gardens serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Characterize the City as a site of potential rebirth, where the specialized skills of the different races (stone and growth) will combine to restore the King’s realm.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli and Legolas look at the City through the lens of their own cultures. This characterizes the "Return of the King" not just as a political event, but as a cultural restoration where all Free Peoples contribute their unique skills to rebuild the world.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Legolas’s reaction to the gulls indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The awakening of the "sea-longing"—an inescapable spiritual homesickness for the West that marks his eventual detachment from Middle-earth.**

**Why this is correct:**
Their voices have "stirred" an ancestral longing. This shows that for the Elves, even victory is "bitter-bought" because it confirms the end of their time in Middle-earth.

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s confession reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The absolute, spiritual potency of the King’s authority, which provided the "anchor" for his companions in a realm of "Unseen" terror.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli is one of the "hardiest" characters, yet he was "put to shame." This emphasizes that the Path of the Dead was a spiritual battle. Only Aragorn had the ontological right to command in that space.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The detail regarding the "wraiths of fear" represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate irony of evil, where the "weapon" of absolute fear—which Sauron used to create the Dead—is turned against him by a legitimate sovereign.**

**Why this is correct:**
By using this "Shadow Host" to defeat the Corsairs, Aragorn turns the Enemy's primary tool against his own allies. It is a moment of poetic and strategic justice.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Legolas’s thought reinforces:**

**Correct Answer: B. The high potential for "Greatness" in Aragorn’s lineage, while identifying his true "nobility" as the choice to remain a servant rather than a master.**

**Why this is correct:**
Legolas recognizes that Aragorn has the inherent capacity for absolute command. However, he identifies Aragorn's spirit as "nobler" because Aragorn chooses *not* to take the Ring.

---

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s warning serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Reframe the strategic goal from "military" victory to a "distraction" mission, providing a "fool’s hope" for the Ring-bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf knows the West cannot defeat Sauron by force. This realization is necessary to move toward the "last move": the march on the Gate. The army’s role is now to act as a "bait."

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s admission reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A calculated act of high-stakes psychological warfare, using his own physical person as a "lure" to keep the Enemy’s attention focused on the King.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn’s goal was to "draw out" the Eye. He is the "lightning rod" for the Shadow. By presenting himself as a rival "Ring-lord," he ensures Sauron’s focus remains on Gondor.

---

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s proposal characterizes their mission as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme act of sacrificial folly—a "Eucatastrophic" gamble that relies on the Enemy’s own greed to facilitate a hidden victory elsewhere.**

**Why this is correct:**
The march is a "jest" because they cannot win. But it is a necessary "move." It characterizes the final battle as a moral performance—walking open-eyed into a trap to fulfill a duty.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Imrahil’s "loud laugh" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "grim" and sophisticated irony, where the Prince acknowledges the absolute absurdity of their force, accepting his role in a likely fatal joke.**

**Why this is correct:**
Imrahil’s laugh is a recognition of the "impossible" nature of the task. This irony is his way of accepting the "doom." It shows he can find a "jest" in the face of death.

---

### Question 10 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s decision marks:**

**Correct Answer: B. The final, irreversible commitment of the "Returned King" to total mobilization, where the physical drawing of the sword acts as a sacred signal.**

**Why this is correct:**
Andúril is the "Flame of the West." Leaving it unsheathed is a symbolic act of ultimate resolve. It signifies that there is no longer any time for "secrecy."
