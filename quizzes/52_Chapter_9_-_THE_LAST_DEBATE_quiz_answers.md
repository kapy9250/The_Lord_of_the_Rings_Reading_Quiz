### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Legolas’s and Gimli’s conversation as they enter the City—where the Dwarf sees "good stone-work" and the Elf sees "dead houses" that need gardens—serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Characterize the City of Gondor as a site of potential rebirth, where the specialized "loves" of the different races (stone and growth) will be combined to restore the beauty of the returned King’s realm.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli and Legolas are looking at the City through the lens of their own cultures. Gimli sees the potential for "town to be proud of" through better stonework, while Legolas wants to bring "birds that sing and trees that do not die." This characterizes the "Return of the King" not just as a political event, but as a cultural and environmental restoration where all Free Peoples contribute their unique skills to rebuild the world.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While there is a "merry" tone to their meeting with the hobbits, their conversation about the City is presented as a serious and visionary discussion of how they can "offer... service" to Aragorn, reflecting their deep respect for his future reign.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Legolas’s reaction to the gulls—feeling "no peace shall I have again under beech or under elm"—indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The awakening of the "sea-longing"—an inescapable, spiritual "homesickness" for the West that marks the beginning of his eventual departure from Middle-earth and his detachment from the lands he previously loved.**

**Why this is correct:**
Galadriel had previously warned Legolas to "beware of the gulls." Their voices have "stirred" a deep, ancestral longing for the Sea (and the path to Valinor). This shows that for the Elves, even victory in Middle-earth is "bitter-bought" because it confirms the end of their time there. Legolas's love for the forest is now "troubled" by a higher, calling desire for the "far country" of his people's origin.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
His longing is for the *Sea itself* and the "High" world it represents, rather than just a different type of earthly forest. The "peace" he has lost is the ability to be content in the terrestrial world.

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s confession that he was "put to shame" on the Paths of the Dead and "held to the road only by the will of Aragorn" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The absolute, near-supernatural potency of the King’s authority, which provided the spiritual "anchor" for his companions in a realm of "Unseen" terror that bypassed their natural physical hardiness.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli is one of the "hardiest" characters, yet he admits he was "put to shame" by the "Shadow-host." This emphasizes that the Path of the Dead was a spiritual battle, not a physical one. Only Aragorn, as the "Heir of Isildur," had the ontological right and the strength of will to command both the living and the dead in that space. Gimli’s confession highlights Aragorn’s "High" status through the eyes of a "stout" peer.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gimli's shame is a result of his own high standards for himself ("deemed himself more tough than Men"). The narrative presents his fear as a natural and overwhelming response to the "wraith-world," which only the "King" could withstand.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The detail that the "designs of Mordor should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness" (the Dead) represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate irony of evil, where the "weapon" of absolute fear—which Sauron used to create the Dead in the first place—is turned against him by a legitimate sovereign who uses it to fulfill a moral obligation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli notes that "with its own weapons was it [Mordor] worsted!" The Dead were a product of Sauron's corruption and Isildur's curse. By using this "Shadow Host" to defeat the Corsairs, Aragorn turns the Enemy's primary tactical tool (terror) against his own allies. It is a moment of poetic and strategic justice where the "Shadow" is used to clear the way for the "Light."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn’s use of the Dead is a "temporary" necessity to fulfill an oath. Once the battle is won, he releases them ("Depart and be at rest!"), showing his commitment to the "White" order of peace and rest, rather than a slide into the "Black" order of permanent, enslaved shadows.

### Question 5 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Legolas’s thought that Aragorn might have become a "great and terrible Lord... had he taken the Ring" reinforces:**

**Correct Answer: B. The high potential for "Greatness" in Aragorn’s lineage, which Sauron perceives as a rival "Power," while identifying his true "nobility" as the choice to remain a "servant" of the West rather than a master.**

**Why this is correct:**
Legolas perceives the "strength of [Aragorn's] will" during the battle of the ships. He recognizes that Aragorn has the inherent capacity for absolute command. This justifies Sauron's fear of him. However, Legolas identifies Aragorn's spirit as "nobler" than Sauron's understanding because Aragorn chooses *not* to take the Ring, proving that his authority is founded on "ancient" virtue rather than "modern" possession.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn defeated the Corsairs without the Ring, using only his "will" and his "Right" as the Heir. Legolas's comment is a reflection on Aragorn's *potential* for evil (which he rejected) rather than a suggestion for a better strategy.

### Question 6 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s warning that "this war then is without final hope... Victory cannot be achieved by arms" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Reframe the strategic goal from a "military" victory to a "distraction" mission, emphasizing that their only role now is to provide a "fool’s hope" for the Ring-bearer by sacrificing themselves.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf is being brutally realistic with the Captains. He knows the "Great" forces of the West cannot defeat Sauron by force. This realization is necessary to move the Council toward the "last move": the march on the Black Gate. The purpose of the army is no longer to "win" the war, but to act as a "bait" to keep the Eye away from Mordor, making the entire military campaign a support act for the "unimportant" hobbits.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Gandalf prefaces his words by saying "I do not bid you despair." His goal is to provide a *true* path to victory (the destruction of the Ring) rather than to encourage a false military hope or a premature surrender.

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s admission that showing himself in the Stone was a challenge to the Enemy "for this very purpose" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A calculated act of self-exposure and high-stakes psychological warfare, where he uses his own physical person as a "lure" to keep the Enemy’s attention focused on the "seen" threat of the King.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn took a massive risk by looking into the Stone. His goal was to "draw out" the Eye of Sauron. This clarifies his strategic role: he is the "lightning rod" for the Shadow. By presenting himself as a rival "Ring-lord" returning to Gondor, he ensures that Sauron’s focus remains on the "White City" and its armies, leaving the back door of Orodruin slightly less guarded.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn's challenge works specifically because Sauron *thinks* Aragorn has the Ring. Aragorn is playing on the Enemy's "blind spot"—Sauron's inability to believe that anyone would have the Ring and *not* use it to challenge him.

---

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s proposal to march on the Black Gate as "the bait, though his jaws should close on us" characterizes their mission as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme act of sacrificial, high-heroic folly—a "Eucatastrophe" in motion that relies on the Enemy’s own "greed" and "insolence" to facilitate a hidden, moral victory elsewhere.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf calls it "wisdom or great folly." The march is a "jest" because they cannot win. But it is a necessary "move" in the larger "jeopardy." It relies on Sauron's "haste and fear." This characterizes the final battle as a moral performance—the Captains are "walking open-eyed into that trap" to fulfill their duty to the Ring-bearer, regardless of their own survival.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The march is *toward* Mordor, the "Land of Shadow," which is the opposite of an escape. It is a deliberate move into the heart of the enemy's strength.

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Imrahil’s "loud laugh" and his comment that the ride is "the greatest jest in all the history of Gondor" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "grim" and sophisticated irony, where the Prince acknowledges the absolute absurdity and "littleness" of their force compared to the "Great" power of Mordor, accepting his role in a "bitter" and likely fatal joke.**

**Why this is correct:**
Imrahil’s laugh is not one of joy, but of "High" recognition of the "impossible" nature of the task. He compares them to a "child with a bow of string." This irony is his way of accepting the "doom" Gandalf has described. It shows his character—he is a man who can find a "jest" in the face of death, reflecting the "Hardihood to die free" that Denethor mentioned but could not achieve.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While it sounds like a jest, Imrahil immediately says "I will go also" and calls Aragorn his "liege-lord." His laugh is a sign of his *total agreement* with the desperate logic of the plan, rather than a mockery of it.

---

### Question 10 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s decision to leave Andúril "unsheathed... until the last battle is fought" marks:**

**Correct Answer: B. The final, irreversible commitment of the "Returned King" to the total mobilization of the West, where the physical drawing of the Sword of Elendil acts as a sacred, irrevocable signal of the world’s ending struggle.**

**Why this is correct:**
Andúril is the "Flame of the West." Leaving it unsheathed is a symbolic act of ultimate martial and royal resolve. It signifies that there is no longer any time for "secrecy" or "waiting." The "King" is now in open, active war. The glittering sword acts as a physical "seal" on the Captains' decision, moving the story into its final, catastrophic movement.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Aragorn explicitly states "the time will not be long" but he also acknowledges the "great jeopardy" and the possibility of their own "utter ruin," characterizing the battle as a decisive and dangerous gamble rather than an easy victory.
