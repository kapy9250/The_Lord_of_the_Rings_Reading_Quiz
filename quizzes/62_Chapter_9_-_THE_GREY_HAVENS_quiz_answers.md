### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Lobelia Bracegirdle’s decision to leave her money to help "hobbits made homeless by the troubles" represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound moral transformation and a sacrificial reconciliation with the community she once resented, where her suffering in the Lockholes has refined her into a figure of late-life "High" generosity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Lobelia was previously the symbol of greed and social friction in the Shire. Her experience of the "Shadow" (her imprisonment and Lotho's death) has "crushed" her old self. By choosing to use her wealth for the "homeless," she performs an act of genuine Shire-justice. This ends the "long feud" and elevates her character to a state of unexpected, noble grace before her death.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
She explicitly "gave back" Bag End to Frodo and "would not return," showing she *remembered* her obsession but consciously chose to relinquish it in favor of her "own people" and her new charitable purpose.

### Question 2 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The 1420 "marvellous year" in the Shire—with its "gleam of a beauty beyond that of mortal summers"—is characterized by the narrator as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "Eucatastrophic" environmental grace and a spiritual blessing from the West, where the physical land itself is allowed a temporary, "High" restoration to compensate for its recent desecration and the Ring-bearer’s suffering.**

**Why this is correct:**
The language used ("gleam of a beauty beyond mortal summers," "richness and growth") suggests a supernatural intervention. Sam's use of Galadriel's dust acts as a catalyst for this "miracle." It signifies that the world's "Light" has returned to the Shire, allowing it to bloom with a vitality that is "more than anyone had hoped for," effectively healing the land's spiritual and physical wounds.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text presents the abundance and the "golden hair" of the children as an objective, miraculous reality of the time ("Altogether 1420 in the Shire was a marvellous year"), rather than a subjective or humorous exaggeration.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s recurring illness on March 13th and October 6th, and his feeling that he is "wounded... it will never really heal," illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The permanent, spiritual "scathe" of his ordeal, where his person has become a living record of the Quest’s physical and metaphysical toll, marking him as a figure who can no longer exist entirely within the "Seen" world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s "fits" occur on the anniversaries of his greatest traumas (the Morgul-blade and Shelob). This shows that the Shadow has left a permanent mark on his spirit. He is "wounded" in a way that the physical world of the Shire cannot cure. This characterizes the hero’s sacrifice as one of ongoing, internal suffering—he saved the world but lost his own ability to be "whole" within it.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text links his illness to the *memory* of the past ("it is my shoulder... the memory of darkness is heavy") rather than an active, independent resurgence of the Ring's own malevolent will.

### Question 4 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s feeling of being "torn in two" between his love for Rosie and his desire to stay with Frodo reveal his:**

**Correct Answer: B. The dual nature of his "High" and "Low" loyalties, where his epic bond with the Ring-bearer now competes with his foundational, domestic identity as a hobbit of the Shire, requiring a new, integrated life at Bag End.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s dilemma is the central conflict of the "returned" soldier. He has a "job" (the Quest) and a "life" (Rosie). By moving into Bag End with Rosie, Sam reconciles these two halves. He becomes the "heir" to both worlds—maintaining the "High" memory of the Quest while fostering the "Low" growth of a new family, providing the model for the Shire's future.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The solution—moving Rosie into Bag End—is *Frodo’s* idea ("how easy!"), and it specifically addresses the need for Sam to be "one and whole" rather than choosing one home over the other.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The different titles Frodo considers for the Red Book—eventually settling on *The Downfall of the Lord of the Rings*—indicate a shift toward:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "High" historical and objective perspective that contextualizes their personal experience within the global and mythic scale of the Age’s ending, while preserving the unique "small" viewpoint of the Little People.**

**Why this is correct:**
The titles move from the personal ("My Diary") to the global ("The Downfall... and the Return of the King"). By adding the subtitle "as seen by the Little People," Frodo asserts the validity of their perspective as a legitimate historical record. This characterizes the book as a work of "High" lore that bridges the gap between the "unimportant" hobbits and the "Great" history of Middle-earth.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Frodo includes "Translations from the Elvish, by B.B.", showing he values and preserves Bilbo's scholarly contribution alongside his own firm, flowing narrative of the War.

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s statement—"I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me"—conveys a theme of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, sacrificial paradox of the hero, whose success in preserving the peace of others necessarily involves his own "fading" and departure from the very world he has enabled to survive.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo recognizes that "someone has to give them up... so that others may keep them." This is the tragic core of his heroism. His total expenditure of spirit to destroy the Ring has rendered him incompatible with the Shire's mundane peace. He accepts his "fading" as part of the price of the victory, choosing to depart so that Sam and the others can have the future he bought for them.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While Sam is "pained" by the lack of honor Frodo receives, Frodo himself is described as having "peace now" and being "himself again." His decision to leave is based on his internal spiritual state and his "Higher" calling, rather than on social resentment.

### Question 7 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of Bilbo "nodding in his sleep" on a small grey pony during the final ride signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The peaceful, "autumnal" completion of his character arc, where the restlessness of his earlier life has been fully resolved into a state of serene, elderly detachment as he prepares for his final journey.**

**Why this is correct:**
Bilbo is "ancient in years" and "sleepy." He has "passed the Old Took." His "nodding" represents the cessation of his "unexpected journey." He is no longer looking for adventure; he is ready for "evening-rest." This provides a peaceful counterpoint to Frodo's "High" sacrificial departure, showing that for some, the end of the Age is simply a time for a long, well-earned sleep.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While there is a contrast in scale, the primary narrative function is to illustrate Bilbo's *character state* (completion and peace) rather than to provide a joke at his expense.

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s revelation of the "Third Ring, Narya the Great" on his hand at the Havens signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The final "unmasking" of his identity and his mission, where the removal of the need for "secrecy" allows him to manifest his true nature as the "Kindler" of hope before his departure from the world he served.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf "wore openly" the Ring of Fire. This is his final act of self-revelation. For two thousand years, his possession of the Ring was a secret. Its revelation at the Havens confirms his role as the "Steward" who was sent to "kindle hearts in a cold world." It marks the end of his "labours" and his return to his original, angelic state.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text says "those who were to go were glad," characterizing the Ring's revelation as a positive sign of the Fellowship's success and the transition to a new era, rather than a threat.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s final vision—the "grey rain-curtain" turning to "silver glass" and revealing "white shores"—represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The supreme "Eucatastrophic" fulfillment of his spiritual destiny, where the "wounds" of the physical world are finally healed by the unveiling of the unfallen, eternal reality of the Blessed Realm.**

**Why this is correct:**
This vision completes the journey begun in Book 1 (his dream in Bombadil's house). The "rain-curtain" of mortal suffering is rolled back to reveal the "far green country." This is Frodo's "Higher" homecoming—a transition into a realm of eternal "sunrise" where his "weariness" will be healed. It provides the final, luminous resolution to the story's "Long Defeat."

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While it *repeats* the dream, its *narrative significance* is that the dream has now become the physical reality of his end, marking the transition from prophecy to fulfillment.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s final words—"Well, I'm back"—and his return to the "yellow light" and the evening meal signify:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, cyclical "centering" of the narrative, where the mythic struggle of the Age finds its final meaning in the restoration and continuity of the "lowly," domestic, and beloved life of the Shire.**

**Why this is correct:**
The book ends not with a King on a throne, but with a hobbit at his own hearth. Sam's return to the "yellow light" and his family anchors the epic story in the domestic world. It affirms that the "Great" wars were fought so that "small" people like Sam could live in peace. His simple words mark the closing of the circle and the beginning of a new, quiet age.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While the war *is* a political victory, the final focus is on the *personal* and *domestic* restoration of Sam’s life, emphasizing the "heart's ease" of the home as the ultimate goal of all the "High" sacrifices.
