### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Lobelia Bracegirdle’s decision to help "homeless hobbits" represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound moral transformation and sacrificial reconciliation, where her suffering in the Lockholes has refined her into a figure of late-life generosity, ending her lifelong obsession with possession.**

**Why this is correct:**
Lobelia was previously the symbol of greed. Her imprisonment and Lotho's death have "crushed" her old self. By using her wealth for the "homeless," she performs an act of genuine Shire-justice. This ends the "long feud" and elevates her character to a state of unexpected grace before her death.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects a "strategic attempt" to repair reputation.
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "secret supporters."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "spiting relatives."
- **E** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "forgetting property."

### Question 2 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The 1420 "marvellous year" is characterized as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "Eucatastrophic" environmental grace and a spiritual blessing from the West, where the land is allowed a temporary, "High" restoration to compensate for its recent desecration.**

**Why this is correct:**
The language ("gleam of a beauty beyond mortal summers") suggests a supernatural intervention. Sam's use of Galadriel's dust acts as a catalyst. It signifies that the world's "Light" has returned to the Shire, allowing it to bloom with a vitality that is "more than anyone had hoped for," effectively healing the land's wounds.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "irrigation and engineering."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "fertile Orc-smoke."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about the "Age of Men."
- **E** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "Sam’s exaggeration."

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s recurring illness illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The permanent, spiritual "scathe" of his ordeal, where his person remains a living record of the Quest’s toll, marking him as someone who can no longer exist entirely within the mundane peace of the "Seen" world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo’s "fits" occur on the anniversaries of his greatest traumas (Weathertop and Shelob). This shows that the Shadow has left a permanent mark on his spirit. He is "wounded" in a way that the physical world cannot cure. This characterizes the hero’s sacrifice as one of ongoing, internal suffering—he saved the world but lost his ability to be "whole" within it.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "medical advice."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "Shadow re-entering the Shire."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "guilt-tripping Sam."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "losing interest in the future."

### Question 4 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s feeling of being "torn in two" reveal his:**

**Correct Answer: B. The dual nature of his "High" and "Low" loyalties, where his epic bond with the Ring-bearer competes with his domestic identity as a hobbit, requiring a new, integrated life at Bag End.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam has a "job" (the Quest) and a "life" (Rosie). By moving into Bag End with Rosie, Sam reconciles these halves. He becomes the "heir" to both worlds—maintaining the "High" memory of the Quest while fostering the "Low" growth of a new family, providing the model for the Shire's future recovery.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "inability to commit."
- **C** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" comparing him to "fragmented Gollum."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about the "physical size of Bag End."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "moving into the Cottons'."

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The different titles Frodo considers indicate a shift toward:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "High" historical perspective that contextualizes their personal suffering within the global and mythic scale of the Age’s ending, while preserving the unique "small" viewpoint.**

**Why this is correct:**
The titles move from the personal ("My Diary") to the global ("The Downfall... and the Return of the King"). By adding the subtitle "as seen by the Little People," Frodo asserts the validity of their perspective as a legitimate historical record. This characterizes the book as a work of "High" lore that bridges the gap between the "unimportant" hobbits and the "Great" history of Middle-earth.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "commercial memoir."
- **C** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "losing individual voice."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "appealing to Men."
- **E** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "better than Bilbo."

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s statement—"it has been saved, but not for me"—conveys a theme of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, sacrificial paradox of the hero, whose success in preserving the peace of others necessitates his own "fading" and departure from the world he enabled to survive.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo recognizes that "someone has to give them up... so that others may keep them." This is the tragic core of his heroism. His total expenditure of spirit has rendered him incompatible with the Shire's mundane peace. He accepts his "fading" as part of the price of the victory, choosing to depart so that Sam and the others can have the future he bought.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects "bitterness and resentment."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "boredom."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "starting a new war."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about "Sam deserving credit" that misses the *sacrificial* point.

### Question 7 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of Bilbo "nodding in his sleep" signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The peaceful, "autumnal" completion of his character arc, where the restlessness of his earlier life has been fully resolved into a state of serene, elderly detachment.**

**Why this is correct:**
Bilbo is "ancient in years" and "sleepy." His "nodding" represents the cessation of his "unexpected journey." He is no longer looking for adventure; he is ready for "evening-rest." This provides a peaceful counterpoint to Frodo's "High" sacrificial departure, showing that for some, the end of the Age is simply a time for a long, well-earned sleep.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects "lack of respect."
- **C** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "uncomfortable ponies."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "losing his mind."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "mocking contrast."

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gandalf’s revelation of the "Third Ring" signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The final "unmasking" of his identity and his mission, where the removal of the need for "secrecy" allows him to manifest his true nature as the "Kindler" of hope.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf "wore openly" the Ring of Fire. This is his final act of self-revelation. For two thousand years, his possession of the Ring was a secret. Its revelation confirms his role as the "Steward" who was sent to "kindle hearts." It marks the end of his "labours" and his return to his original, angelic state.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "showing off."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "stealing the Ring."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "danger of a new war."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "finding a new home."

### Question 9 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s final vision represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The supreme "Eucatastrophic" fulfillment of his spiritual destiny, where the "wounds" of the physical world are finally healed by the unveiling of an eternal, unfallen reality.**

**Why this is correct:**
This vision completes the journey begun in Book 1 (his dream in Bombadil's house). The "rain-curtain" of mortal suffering is rolled back to reveal the "far green country." This is Frodo's "Higher" homecoming—a transition into a realm of eternal "sunrise" where his "weariness" will be healed. It provides the final, luminous resolution to the story.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "literal maps."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "sea-weather."
- **D** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "near-death hallucination."
- **E** is a "Lore-Trap" about "repetition of the dream."

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s final words signify:**

**Correct Answer: B. The ultimate, cyclical "centering" of the narrative, where the mythic struggle of the Age finds its final meaning in the restoration and continuity of the "lowly," domestic, and beloved life of the Shire.**

**Why this is correct:**
The book ends not with a King on a throne, but with a hobbit at his own hearth. Sam's return to the "yellow light" and his family anchors the epic story in the domestic world. It affirms that the "Great" wars were fought so that "small" people could live in peace. His simple words mark the closing of the circle.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "escaping the burden of friendship."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "forgetting the High world."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about "Dark Lord of Bag End."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "human political victory."
