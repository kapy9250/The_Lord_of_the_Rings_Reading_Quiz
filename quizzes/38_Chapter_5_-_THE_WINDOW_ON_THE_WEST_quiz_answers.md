### Question 1 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s statement that he would not "snare even an orc with a falsehood" establishes his character as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A man of absolute, ontological integrity, whose commitment to "Truth" is a rejection of the "crooked" and manipulative logic that defines the Enemy’s power.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir’s refusal to use "falsehood" even against an Orc defines his moral core. This establishes him as the "true" Man of the West—one who values means as much as ends. This quality allows him to resist the Ring’s temptation; he is fundamentally incompatible with the "crooked" logic Sauron and Saruman use.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that labels integrity as "tactical impracticality."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "denethor’s house losing its edge."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "Orcish susceptibility to truth."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" that suspects a "manipulative mask."

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s decision to confront Faramir reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. The strength of his domestic Shire-morality, which allows him to bypass social hierarchies and defend his master through an authentic, "neighborly" bluntness.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s "bristling" and "hands on hips" is a domestic, Shire-like posture. He isn't intimidated by Faramir’s rank. His love for Frodo provides a "boldness" that allows him to speak his mind plainly, showing the "little people" have a dignity that stands "eye to eye" with the "Great."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that labels Sam as "failing to grasp stakes."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "ent-draught."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "becoming as wild as Ithilien."
- **E** is a "Comedy" distractor about the "Captain status as a joke."

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s account of seeing Boromir suggests that his perception is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A high-order visionary clarity that allows those of High Numenorean descent to perceive spiritual realities that exist beyond the "Seen" world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir’s vision is a sign of spiritual sensitivity. He perceives the truth of Boromir's end through a "waking" vision, confirming that the high Numenorean lineage still possesses a connection to mythic realities. The discovery of the "horn" in the material world confirms its accuracy.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "dehydration and mourning."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "Elven tracking devices."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "Mirror of Galadriel."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "delaying physical reality."

### Question 4 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s realization that Boromir "died well" indicates his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Intuitive understanding of the "spiritual economy" of Middle-earth, where physical defeat is redeemed by an internal moral triumph.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir notes Boromir's face was "more beautiful even than in life." He understands the spiritual logic: Boromir was "proud," but also "valiant." Faramir correctly guesses that Boromir's end involved a moral "victory" (as Aragorn also called it), proving his own wisdom.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Half-Truth" about "dismissing the tactical importance of the Ring."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" using the term "naturally beautiful in death."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "Aragorn blaming Gondor."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "sanitizing memory."

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s description of Gondor as a "springless autumn" reflects:**

**Correct Answer: B. The "Long Defeat," where the high human culture of the past is waning due to its own internal moral stagnation.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir explains Gondor brought about "its own decay" by hungering after "endless life." This "autumnal" state is a hallmark of Numenorean decline. They live on memory while their vitality "decreases" in the face of the Enemy's "increase."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "Mordor-pollution."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "luring Sauron into security."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about "moving to the Shire."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "clinical depression."

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s poetic description of Galadriel suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. The transformative power of mythic beauty, which forces a "simple" mind into a state of authentic and sophisticated linguistic creativity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam produces sophisticated, contradictory metaphors that perfectly capture Galadriel's nature. This illustrates how the encounter with the "High" world has "awakened" Sam's own internal depth, allowing him to speak with a beauty he didn't know he possessed.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "wooing Faramir."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "Elven-addiction."
- **D** is a "Half-Truth" about "tactical distraction" that misses the *aesthetic* experience.
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "nonsense."

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s vow highlights his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Intellectual and moral "clarity," where he recognizes the Ring’s inherent corruption and chooses to remain within the "bounds" of human integrity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir is "wise enough to know" perils from which to flee. Unlike Boromir, who believed his strength could master it, Faramir understands the Ring is a "fell weapon." His refusal is based on a realistic assessment of human limitation and a rejection of "glory" at the cost of "wisdom."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that labels clarity as "lack of ambition."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "legal challenges from Aragorn."
- **D** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "dangerous highways."
- **E** is a "Lore-Trap" about a "better weapon in Ithilien."

### Question 8 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of Henneth Annûn serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Provide a moment of high-aesthetic "reward" that counteracts the "grey" and "desolate" reality of the war, reinforcing the beauty Gondor defends.**

**Why this is correct:**
Henneth Annûn is a "fair" place. The description of the sunset through water uses the language of "jewels." This visual beauty provides a tonal respite from the "smoke" of the Black Gate, reminding the reader of the "White" world still worth fighting for.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "filtering water with gems."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "lost Dwarven kingdoms."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "destroying Mordor with solar fire."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about "tactical invisibility."

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s comment that Faramir "reminds me of wizards" indicates that Faramir possesses:**

**Correct Answer: B. The surviving spiritual dignity of High Numenor, where wisdom and self-restraint manifest as a presence that simpler folk perceive as "wizard-like."**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir identifies this as the "air of Numenor." It is a quality of character—wisdom and moral authority—preserved in his house. This presence sets him apart from his "martial" brother and aligns him with the "Wise" (like Gandalf), highlighting the survival of "High" human culture.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "changing physical appearance."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "masquerading Wizards."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about "wizard-smoke."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "Magic vs Nobility."

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s reaction to Frodo’s mission characterizes his response as:**

**Correct Answer: B. Profound, empathetic "awe" and protective care, recognizing the staggering weight of the "doom" laid upon a "little halfling."**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir is "grave" and "astonished." He realizes Frodo is attempting a task the "great ones" could not. His gentle treatment of the sleeping Frodo is an act of "pity and honour." He accepts his role as a secondary character supporting the "Bearer" rather than the "Power."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects "surveillance."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "dying kings."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "stealing loyalty."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about "Rangers as healers."
