### Question 1 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s statement that he would not "snare even an orc with a falsehood" primarily establishes his character as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A man of absolute, uncompromising integrity whose commitment to "truth-speaking" is an ontological state rather than a mere tactical choice, marking him as a high-noble contrast to the "crooked" Saruman.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir’s refusal to use "falsehood" even against an enemy (an Orc) defines his moral core. This establishes him as the "true" Man of the West—one who values the means as much as the ends. This quality is what allows him to resist the Ring’s temptation later; he is fundamentally incapable of the "crooked" logic that Sauron and Saruman use to justify their actions.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he avoids deception, he is described as having "keen wit" and being a "Captain" who successfully ambushed the Southrons. He is highly effective in war; his refusal to lie is a *moral* constraint, not a sign of tactical incompetence.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s decision to confront Faramir squarely, addressing him like a "young hobbit who had offered him 'sauce'," reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The irrepressible strength of his "Shire-justice," where his protective loyalty to Frodo allows him to bypass his own social class anxieties and treat a "great Man" as a mere neighbor in a dispute.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s "bristling with wrath" and his "hands on his hips" is a domestic, Shire-like posture. He isn't intimidated by Faramir’s rank or "stern" face. His love for Frodo provides him with a "boldness" that allows him to speak his mind plainly, demonstrating that the "little people" have their own kind of dignity that can stand "eye to eye" with the "Great."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Sam's confrontation is an act of *selfless* defense for his master, rather than an expression of personal "pride" or ambition like Boromir’s.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s account of seeing Boromir in the funeral boat—"Dreamlike it was, and yet no dream, for there was no waking"—suggests that his perception is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A high-order "visionary" clarity, common among those of Numenorean descent, which allows for the perception of spiritual and physical truths that cross the boundaries of the "Seen" world.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text notes that "tidings of death have many wings" and "night oft brings news to near kindred." Faramir’s vision is a sign of his spiritual sensitivity. He perceives the truth of Boromir's end through a "waking" vision, confirming that the high Numenorean lineage still possesses a connection to the deeper, mythic realities of Middle-earth.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The discovery of the "cloven horn" in the physical world confirms that his vision was an accurate report of reality, rather than a subjective hallucination caused by grief.

### Question 4 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s realization that Boromir "died well, achieving some good thing" indicates his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Deep, intuitive understanding of the "moral arc" of Boromir’s life, recognizing that the beauty of his face in death is a spiritual sign of his successful final redemption.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir notes that Boromir's face was "more beautiful even than in life." He understands the spiritual logic of his brother's character: Boromir was "proud and fearless," but he was also "valiant." Faramir correctly guesses that Boromir's end involved a moral "victory" (as Aragorn also called it), proving his own wisdom as a judge of souls.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Faramir is not making a general statement about war; he is commenting specifically on his *brother's* face and his intuitive sense of the specific "achieving" that happened in Boromir's final moments.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s description of Gondor as a "springless autumn" and a "failing people" reflects a theme of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The "Long Defeat," where the high human civilization of the past is inevitably waning due to its own internal moral decay and the overwhelming, persistent growth of the Shadow.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir explains that Gondor brought about "its own decay" by hungering after "endless life" and counting "old names... dearer than the names of sons." This "autumnal" state is a hallmark of the Numenorean decline. They are living on the memory of past greatness, while their physical and spiritual vitality "decreases" in the face of the Enemy's "increase."

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While the White Tree is a symbol of the kingdom, Faramir’s focus is on the *people* and their *culture* ("dotage," "heraldry," "withered men"), rather than a specific physical plant.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s poetic description of Galadriel ("Hard as di'monds, soft as moonlight... Proud and far-off... and as merry as any lass") suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. The profound and paradoxical impact of the "High" Elven presence on a "simple" hobbit, where the experience of mythic beauty forces him into a state of authentic, if "unpolished," linguistic creativity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam prefaces his words by saying he's "not much good at poetry." Yet, he produces a series of sophisticated, contradictory metaphors that perfectly capture Galadriel's multifaceted nature. This illustrates how the encounter with the "High" world of the Elves has "awakened" Sam's own internal depth, allowing him to speak with a beauty he didn't know he possessed.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Sam’s tone is one of reverent "nonsense" and "love," rather than a desire to compete with or impress Faramir. He is trying to convey a truth that he feels "ought to be sung."

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s vow—"Not if I found it on the highway would I take it"—distinguishes him from his brother by highlighting his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Intellectual and moral "clarity," where he recognizes the Ring's inherent evil and consciously chooses to remain within the "bounds" of his own character rather than reach for a corrupted power.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir says he is "wise enough to know that there are some perils from which a man must flee." Unlike Boromir, who believed his own strength could master the Ring, Faramir understands that the Ring is "Isildur's Bane" and a "fell weapon." His refusal is based on a realistic assessment of human limitation and a rejection of "glory" at the cost of "wisdom."

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text presents Faramir's choice as an act of supreme *strength* and *will* ("I pass the test," similar to Galadriel's words), rather than a lack of ambition or cowardice.

### Question 8 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of Henneth Annûn, the "Window of the Sunset," where the waterfall is "curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold," serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Provide a moment of high-aesthetic "reward" and mythic light that counteracts the "grey" and "desolate" reality of the war, reinforcing the "unseen" beauty that Gondor still defends.**

**Why this is correct:**
Henneth Annûn is a "fair" place in a "land of many fountains." The description of the sunset through the water uses the language of Elven-towers and "jewels." This visual beauty provides a tonal respite from the "smoke" and "filth" of the Black Gate, reminding the reader (and the hobbits) of the "White" world that is still worth fighting for.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Faramir *does* mention the cave's defensibility, but the specific, poetic description of the *Window of the Sunset* is presented as a "reward" for the hobbits' "patience," focusing on its beauty rather than its tactical utility.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s comment that "you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of... Gandalf, of wizards" indicates that Faramir possesses:**

**Correct Answer: B. The surviving spiritual and ancestral "dignity" of High Numenor, where wisdom, self-restraint, and a connection to the "Old" world manifest as a presence that simpler folk perceive as "wizard-like."**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir identifies this "air" as the "air of Numenor." It is a quality of character—a mixture of "gravity," "lore," and moral authority—that has been preserved in his house. This presence sets him apart from his more "martial" brother and aligns him with the "Wise" (like Gandalf and Elrond), highlighting the survival of "High" human culture in Gondor.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Gandalf is an Istari (a supernatural being), while Faramir is a Man. Sam's comparison is about their shared *quality of presence* and wisdom, not their biological or magical nature.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s reaction to Frodo’s true mission—lifting him "gently" and carrying him to bed—characterizes his response to the Ring-bearer as one of:**

**Correct Answer: B. Profound, empathetic "awe" and protective care, recognizing the staggering weight of the "doom" that has been laid upon a "little halfling" and choosing to act as his guardian rather than his master.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir is "grave" and "astonished." He realizes that Frodo is attempting a task that "the great ones could not go, or dared not go." His gentle treatment of the sleeping Frodo is an act of "pity and honour." He accepts his role as a secondary character in Frodo's epic, choosing to support the "Bearer" rather than try to seize the "Power."

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The entire chapter builds toward Faramir's decision to *let them go* ("it shall turn to his good, if it is in my power"), proving that his "care" is genuine and not a plan for capture.
