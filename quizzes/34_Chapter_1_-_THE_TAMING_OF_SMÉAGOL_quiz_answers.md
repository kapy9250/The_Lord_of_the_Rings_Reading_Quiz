### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "shudder" when he looks toward Mordor and mutters "If I must go there, I wish I could come there quickly and make an end!" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound psychological weariness and a longing for the finality of the quest, even if that end is death, suggesting that the "delay" is more painful than the destination itself.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is "delayed" in the Emyn Muil. He says "I grudge every hour, every minute." His desire to "make an end" shows that he is no longer motivated by a desire for survival or victory, but by a desperate need to fulfill his "doom" and be released from the crushing weight of the Ring and the "odour of cold decay" from Mordor.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text emphasizes his "weariness," his "shudder," and his feeling of being "tired." He is not looking for glory; he is looking for a way to finish a task that has become an existential burden.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Emyn Muil as a "strange twisted knot of hills" where the hobbits "lost count of the hours" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Mirror the hobbits' internal state of confusion, isolation, and spiritual "entrapment," where the physical landscape becomes a manifestation of their own increasingly desperate and circular situation.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "circular" and "twisted" nature of the hills is a literalization of the hobbits' dilemma. They retrace steps, wander in circles, and face "sheer, high and impassable" faces. This environmental frustration reflects Frodo’s own "twisted" sense of time and his belief that "all my choices have proved ill," heightening the reader's sense of their isolation.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn previously praised their resourcefulness. The difficulty lies in the "unnatural" and "strange" quality of the Emyn Muil itself, rather than a lack of navigational skill.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "sudden strange vehemence" in refusing to wait until morning to climb the cliff indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. An escalating internal pressure and a mounting obsession with the "time" he is losing, showing that the mission has become an all-consuming psychological weight that overrides his natural caution.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo "grudges every hour." His vehemence is described as "strange," suggesting it is not his normal personality. This indicates the Ring's growing psychological pressure, which manifest as a frantic, almost irrational urgency to move toward the "Shadow" that is drawing him. He is choosing a high-risk climb over a safe delay.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While they do end up using the moonlight, Frodo's decision is made *before* the moon rises, driven by his internal "vehemence" and his refusal to spend a "moment longer than I need" on the edge.

---

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "shimmering" and "silver sheen" of the Elven-rope in the dark primarily emphasizes its nature as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A tool of "light" and Elven-virtue that provides physical and spiritual clarity in a place dominated by "Shadow," acting as a literal and metaphorical lifeline for the Ring-bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
The rope "seemed to shimmer" and was "silver in the dark." For Frodo, it was the "point in the darkness" that allowed him to see again. In Tolkien's world, Elven artifacts are physically and spiritually resistant to the Shadow. The rope provides not just physical support, but a spiritual counterpoint to the "cold blades of horror" brought by the Nazgûl.

**Why E is incorrect** `[CC]`:
The rope's "silver sheen" is a sign of its Elven origin and "goodness," which is the very thing that "hurts" Gollum later, rather than something that helps him follow them.

---

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s "injured tones" when Frodo laughs at the rope coming loose reveal his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Deep-seated pride in his craft and his family’s professional identity, where his competence with "homely" skills is his primary source of self-worth in a world of epic heroes.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam defends his knowledge of knots as something "in the family." He is sensitive to the suggestion that he failed in his craft. This highlights Sam's role as the "everyman" or the "yeoman" of the quest; his pride is not in martial glory but in the "professional" excellence of a Shire gardener/worker.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he is "annoyed," the reason is his "injured" pride in his family's reputation for knots, rather than a general loss of temper or a desire to act like Gandalf.

---

### Question 6 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The appearance of Gollum descending the cliff "like a nasty crawling spider on a wall" serves narratively to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Visually manifest Gollum’s utter dehumanization and his adaptation to the "wild" world through centuries of isolation and the Ring’s influence, framing him as a predatory and "unnatural" extension of the landscape.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "spider" simile emphasizes Gollum's loss of his original hobbit form. His limbs are "splayed," he moves on "sticky pads," and he is "insect-kind." This dehumanization is a visual summary of the Ring's effect: it has turned a person into a "creature" that is more at home on a vertical precipice than in a comfortable hole.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The tone of the passage is one of "horror and despair" and "shudders," rather than humor. Gollum's descent is a moment of intense tension and revelation of his "dangerous" nature.

---

### Question 7 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to spare Gollum, hearing the "voices out of the past" (Gandalf), represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A conscious, moral alignment with Gandalf’s philosophy of mercy, recognizing his own growing kinship with the "wretched" creature and the spiritual necessity of rejecting the Enemy’s "justice" of death.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo explicitly quotes Gandalf's words about "Pity and Mercy." By saying "now that I see him, I do pity him," Frodo demonstrates his spiritual maturation. He recognizes that killing Gollum would be an act based on "fearing for your own safety," and he chooses the "Wise" path of sparing a life, even when it seems strategically risky.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he does end up using Gollum as a guide, his *initial* motivation for sparing him is the "Pity" he feels when confronted with Gollum's "misery" and his own memory of Gandalf's advice.

---

### Question 8 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s reaction to the Elven-rope ("It freezes, it bites!") confirms that his nature has become:**

**Correct Answer: B. Ontologically allergic to anything associated with the unfallen, "pure" light of the Elves, where the physical contact with Elven-craft causes him literal, spiritual agony due to his own deep corruption.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum screams that "Elves twisted it." The rope is "soft as milk" to Sam, but "freezes" and "bites" Gollum. This is a clear indicator of Gollum's profound corruption. He can no longer touch anything "good" or "bright" without pain. It establishes the "Elvish" as a literal and spiritual repellent to the servants of the Shadow.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Frodo "examined [the knot] and found that it was not too tight," proving that the "pain" is not physical but spiritual in origin.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s observation that his master had "grown" while Gollum had "shrunk" during the swearing of the oath indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological manifestation of Frodo’s developing moral and spiritual authority, where his role as the "Master of the Precious" temporarily elevates him to a "lordly" status that overwhelms Gollum’s "whining" dependency.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text describes Frodo as a "tall stern shadow, a mighty lord." This vision is a reflection of Frodo's new role. He is asserting his will over Smeagol through his authority as the Ring-bearer. It shows that Frodo's "inner light" (or the Ring's proximity) is creating a new, more formidable presence that Gollum instinctively recognizes and fears.

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While the "lordly" power is unsettling to Sam, the text emphasizes Frodo's "stern pity" and his "brightness" (hidden in cloud), rather than an evil transformation into a Dark Lord.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s "capering" and "pitiful anxiety to please" after the rope is removed characterizes his "Smeagol" persona as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A survival-based, fawning submissiveness that uses the "Smeagol" persona as a psychological mask to win the trust of the "nice hobbits" while his deeper "Gollum" self remains focused on the "Precious."**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum is described as "like a whipped cur." His friendliness is "pitifully anxious." This behavior is a form of fawning—a psychological defense mechanism used by the oppressed to manipulate their "masters" for survival. Sam's "deep suspicion" is the correct response; he sees the "Gollum" lurking beneath the performative "Smeagol" helpfulness.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text notes that his voice and language changed "for some time," but Sam’s continued suspicion and the later "Gollum" outbursts prove that the restoration is neither complete nor permanent.
