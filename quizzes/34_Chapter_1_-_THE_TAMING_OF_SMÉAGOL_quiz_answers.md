### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "shudder" and his desire to "make an end" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A profound existential weariness, where the "delay" of the journey has become more psychologically agonizing than the prospect of death itself.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo is "delayed" in the Emyn Muil. He says "I grudge every hour." His desire to "make an end" shows he is no longer motivated by survival, but by a need to fulfill his "doom" and be released from the weight of the Ring. The "end" he seeks is the completion of the task, regardless of whether he survives it.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects "martial energy" or "heroism."
- **C** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "eroding Shire-morality."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "heat of the land" neutralizing the Ring.
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "hiding fear through performance."

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Emyn Muil as a "twisted knot" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Mirror the hobbits’ internal state of spiritual "entrapment," where the physical landscape becomes a manifestations of their own circular and increasingly desperate situation.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "circular" nature of the hills mirrors the hobbits' dilemma. They retrace steps and face "impassable" faces. This environmental frustration reflects Frodo’s own "twisted" sense of time and his belief that his choices have gone "amiss." The landscape is an externalization of their psychological tunnel.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "logistical explanations."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Elven magical construction."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "inherent lack of skill."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "detective genre."

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "sudden strange vehemence" indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. An escalating internal pressure and a mounting obsession with "time," showing the Ring’s influence as it draws him toward the Shadow with an almost irrational urgency.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo "grudges every hour." His vehemence is "strange," suggesting it’s not his normal self. This indicates the Ring’s psychological pressure—a frantic urgency to move toward the "Shadow" that is drawing him. He chooses a high-risk climb over a safe delay.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Half-Truth" about "winged Nazgûl" that ignores the *internal* nature of the "vehemence."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "shaming Sam."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "Morgul-poison and physical strength."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "mastery over Sam."

**The "shimmering" of the Elven-rope emphasizes its nature as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A tool of "un-shadowed" virtue that provides literal and metaphorical clarity, acting as a spiritual lifeline in a landscape defined by "decay."**

**Why this is correct:**
The rope was "silver in the dark." For Frodo, it was the "point in the darkness" that allowed him to see. Elven artifacts are physically and spiritually resistant to the Shadow. The rope provides a spiritual counterpoint to the "cold decay" of the Emyn Muil.

- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "material possession."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "radioactive materials."

**The appearance of Gollum as a "spider" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Visually manifest Gollum’s utter dehumanization, framing him as a predatory and "unnatural" extension of the barren landscape.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "spider" simile emphasizes Gollum's loss of his original hobbit form. His limbs are "splayed," he moves on "sticky pads." This dehumanization is a visual summary of the Ring's effect: it has turned a person into a "creature" at home on a vertical precipice.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Mirkwood spiders."
- **C** is a "Comedy" distractor about "hobbits' clumsy climbing."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that labels mercy as "weakness."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Ring telepathy."

**Correct Answer: B. Ontologically allergic to anything associated with "pure" light or unfallen craft, where physical contact causing literal spiritual agony.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum screams that it "bites." The rope is "soft as milk" to Sam, but "hurts" Gollum. This is a clear indicator of his profound corruption. He can no longer touch anything "good" or "bright" without pain. It establishes the "Elvish" as a spiritual repellent.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "fiber allergies."

**Correct Answer: B. A survival-based, fawning submissiveness that uses the "Smeagol" mask to manipulate the "nice hobbits" while his core "Gollum" self remains hidden.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum is described as "like a whipped cur." His behavior is a form of fawning—a psychological defense mechanism used by the oppressed to manipulate "masters." Sam's suspicion is correct; he sees the "Gollum" lurking beneath the "Smeagol" helpfulness.
