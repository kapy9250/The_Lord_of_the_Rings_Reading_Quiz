### Question 1 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s deduction regarding the "dispute about the road" among the dead Orcs primarily illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. His deep, cynical understanding of the inherent instability of evil alliances, which are undermined by internal competition, racial hatred, and a lack of unified moral purpose.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn recognizes that the "Northern Orcs" and the "great Orcs" (Uruk-hai) were at odds. He notes that quarrels are "no uncommon thing with these foul folk." This illustrates a major theme in Tolkien's work: evil is self-destructive and incapable of true fellowship. The "riddle" of the dead Orcs reveals the internal fractures within Sauron and Saruman's forces.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn explicitly calls them "foul folk" and notes they were "hewn with many cruel strokes." There is no suggestion of a benevolent rescue; rather, it was a "dispute" that turned violent.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s song for Gondor ("Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!") at dawn serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Psychologically anchor his current "vain pursuit" in the mythic and ancestral importance of his ultimate goal, creating a moment of emotional centering before turning back to the "hard" reality of the chase.**

**Why this is correct:**
The dawn view of the White Mountains triggers Aragorn's longing for his home and his destiny. By singing, he acknowledges the "bright streams" and "proud walls" he is currently forswearing to find the hobbits. The song acts as a bridge between his personal desire ("Would that I looked on you again") and his immediate duty, reinforcing his resolve.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he looks at the South, he immediately says "Not yet does my road lie southward" and turns "west and north to the way that he must tread." The song is a farewell to a hope, not an abandonment of his friends.

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The discovery of the Elven-brooch and Aragorn’s comment that "Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. An affirmation of the hobbits’ resourcefulness and agency, recognizing that even in captivity, they are actively communicating and maintaining hope through symbolic gestures.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn interprets the dropped brooch as a deliberate "token." This "heartening" discovery proves that the hobbits (specifically Pippin) have "the use of [their] wits." It transforms them from "cattle" or passive victims into active participants in their own rescue, validating the Company's continued pursuit.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Aragorn's analysis is based on Pippin's *character* and the "boldness" of the act, rather than on a belief in the object's inherent magical properties (though the brooch is indeed "fair and strange").

---

### Question 4 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s internal struggle with his "ill choices" since the Argonath indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological burden of the "Return of the King" narrative, where every setback is interpreted as a failure of his own providential worthiness and a sign of a dark, inescapable fate.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn calls himself an "ill chooser" and worries that the pursuit is "vain." His doubt is tied to the heavy responsibility he has inherited. In a world where "fate" and "ordered" meetings (as Elrond said) are real, Aragorn fears that his failures mean he is not the chosen leader he is supposed to be. This vulnerability adds depth to his character as he struggles with his destiny.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Aragorn remains the guide and decision-maker; his "surrender" is an internal, emotional expression of doubt, not a literal abdication of his role to Gimli.

---

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "red dawn" and Legolas’s comment that "strange things await us... we are called" creates an atmosphere of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A heightened, supernatural urgency where the environment itself (the "red dawn") signals a shift into a new phase of the quest where the normal laws of the world are suspended.**

**Why this is correct:**
In Tolkien's work, nature often mirrors the moral and spiritual state of the world. A "red dawn" is an ominous sign ("Blood has been spilled this night," as popular adaptations put it). Legolas, with his Elven sensitivity, perceives that they are being "called" by events beyond their sight, moving the story from a simple chase into a mythic encounter.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While a red sky in the morning can mean rain, the text emphasizes the "strange things" and the "calling," suggesting a mythic rather than a meteorological significance.

### Question 6 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s description of the Rohirrim as "proud and wilful... bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned" characterizes them as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "heroic age" society that preserves a noble, uncorrupted human vitality through oral tradition and martial ethics, standing in contrast to the more "learned" but waning Gondor.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn contrasts them with the "children of Men before the Dark Years." By calling them "wise but unlearned" (writing no books but singing many songs), he identifies them as a culture that relies on direct experience and oral history. They represent a more "youthful" and vigorous stage of human civilization, which Aragorn respects despite their "wilfulness."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
They are fiercely loyal to "Theoden King," showing that their wilfulness does not preclude a strong social and political order.

---

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Éomer’s reaction to the name "Halflings"—calling it a "little people in old songs"—highlights the theme of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The collision between the mundane, "daylight" world of political reality and the resurfacing of mythic history, where the characters find themselves literally "walking in legends."**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn’s response is key: "A man may do both." He argues that what Men call "legend" is simply history they have forgotten or moved away from. The appearance of an Elf, a Dwarf, and the news of Halflings in the fields of Rohan forces Éomer to recognize that the "old songs" are becoming the reality of his own time.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The Rohirrim are described as "singing many songs"; the issue is not a lack of music, but a disbelief that the *subjects* of those songs (Halflings) actually exist in the physical world.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s revelation of himself and Andúril to Éomer, where he seems to "grow in stature," represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The spiritual and psychological manifestation of his innate royal authority, which overwhelms the local authority of Éomer through the sheer force of his "unmasked" identity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn "uncloaks" himself both literally and figuratively. The "white flame" on his brow and his "kingly" face are external signs of his spiritual power. By claiming his full title and drawing the Sword that was Broken, he asserts a cosmic authority that demands Éomer's respect ("look of awe"). It is a moment of pure, sovereign presence.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text presents this as a genuine change in perception ("vision of the power and majesty") triggered by Aragorn’s own internal transformation, rather than a deceptive "trick" or "illusion."

---

### Question 9 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Éomer’s decision to lend the horses to the Company, placing his "very life" in the keeping of Aragorn’s good faith, demonstrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. An intuitive and high-stakes recognition of Aragorn’s character, where the bond of individual "good faith" between noble Men supersedes the rigid, paranoid laws of a state in crisis.**

**Why this is correct:**
Éomer is breaking the law of his king to help Aragorn. He admits he is "not free to do all as I would," but he chooses to trust his "heart" and Aragorn's "truth." This reflects the "heroic" bond where personal honor and the recognition of nobility are more binding than legal statutes, especially in "days of doubt."

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While the horses might be "wise," Éomer’s primary concern is his own "good faith" and the "proof" he must eventually offer to his king, showing he views it as a serious moral and political risk.

---

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The appearance of the "old bent man" at the edge of the fire, who disappears without a word, serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Introduce a moment of profound ambiguity and dread, manifesting the "peril" of Fangorn and the suspected reach of Saruman’s "many guises" into the Company's camp.**

**Why this is correct:**
The old man is a silent, threatening presence. His appearance (hat and staff) matches the description of Saruman "hooded and cloaked." The subsequent loss of the horses increases the Company's isolation and vulnerability. Narratively, this moment heightens the tension and introduces the "queerness" of Fangorn, making the hunters feel they are being actively toyed with by a superior power.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While the reader (and the characters) might hope it's Gandalf, the "ill fortune" of the horses' disappearance and the silent, uncommunicative nature of the man create a sense of threat and "peril" rather than hope.
