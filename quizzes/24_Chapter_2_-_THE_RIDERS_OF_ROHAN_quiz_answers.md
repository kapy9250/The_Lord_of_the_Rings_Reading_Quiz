### Question 1 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s deduction regarding the "dispute about the road" among the dead Orcs primarily illustrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A deep, cynical understanding of the inherent instability of evil, which lacks a unified moral center and inevitably collapses into internal racial and factional violence.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn recognizes that the "Northern Orcs" and the Uruk-hai were at odds. He notes that quarrels are "no uncommon thing with these foul folk." This illustrates a major theme: evil is self-destructive and incapable of true fellowship. The "riddle" reveals the internal fractures within the Enemy’s forces.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" that reduces an ontological truth to a "navigational tool" issue.
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" that suspects "sabotage," which the text’s focus on "foul folk" and "cruel strokes" contradicts.
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" that invents a "confusion-spell."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about their "foul nature" that misses the specific *political* and *factional* nature of the dispute.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s song for Gondor at dawn serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Psychologically anchor his identity in his ultimate royal destiny, providing a moment of emotional fortitude before returning to the "vain" and grueling task of the hunt.**

**Why this is correct:**
The dawn view triggers Aragorn's longing. By singing, he acknowledges the "proud walls" he is currently forswearing. The song acts as a bridge between his personal desire and his immediate duty, reinforcing his resolve to turn "west and north."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "formal signals."
- **C** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the parallel of "broken poetry."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "predicting destruction."
- **E** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects "ambition" over "safety."

### Question 3 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The discovery of the Elven-brooch reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. An affirmation of the hobbits’ resilient agency, recognizing that they are using their wits to actively participate in their own rescue through symbolic communication.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn interprets the dropped brooch as a deliberate "token." This proves the hobbits have "the use of [their] wits." It transforms them from "cattle" into active participants, validating the Company's continued pursuit.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "careless treatment."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "inherent gravity."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "systematic stripping" of status.
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "Galadriel following in cloaked form."

### Question 4 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s internal struggle with his "ill choices" indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological weight of the "Chosen One" archetype, where any tactical failure is interpreted as a sign of personal unworthiness and spiritual "ill fortune."**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn calls himself an "ill chooser." In a world where "fate" is real, he fears his failures mean he is not the chosen leader he is supposed to be. This vulnerability adds depth to his character as he struggles with his destiny.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "Gandalf’s death."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "mutiny."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" using the "Black Breath" to explain a genuine leadership crisis.
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "Saruman’s will" controlling the Ring-bearer’s fate.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "red dawn" and Legolas’s comment create an atmosphere of:**

**Correct Answer: B. A heightened, mythic urgency where the environment itself signals a transition into a realm where the normal boundaries between "legend" and "reality" are dissolved.**

**Why this is correct:**
In Tolkien's work, nature often mirrors the spiritual state. A "red dawn" is an ominous sign. Legolas perceives they are being "called" by events beyond their sight, moving the story into a mythic encounter.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "weather forecasting."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "Orcish celebrations."
- **D** is a "Half-Truth" about "daylight" that misses the *calling* aspect.
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "corrupted Sun."

### Question 6 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s description of the Rohirrim characterizes them as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "Heroic Age" society that maintains a vigorous, uncorrupted human spirit through oral tradition, standing in contrast to the fading, "learned" culture of Gondor.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn contrasts them with the "children of Men before the Dark Years." By calling them "wise but unlearned," he identifies them as a culture that relies on oral history. They represent a more "youthful" stage of human civilization.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" calling them "wild men" and a "threat."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "susceptibility to Saruman."
- **D** is a "Lore-Trap" calling them a "degenerate branch."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about "song vs victory."

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Éomer’s reaction to "Halflings" highlights the theme of:**

**Correct Answer: B. The collision between the mundane world of "daylight" politics and the resurfacing of mythic history, where the protagonists are forced to "walk in legends."**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn argues that "A man may do both." He claims what Men call "legend" is simply history they have forgotten. The appearance of an Elf and a Dwarf forces Éomer to recognize that the "old songs" are the reality of his time.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "scientific skepticism."
- **C** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "lack of imagination."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "Elven shrinking magic."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" calling songs "propaganda."

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s revelation of himself and Andúril represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The manifestation of his innate royal authority, which overwrites his "Strider" persona through the sheer ontological force of his revealed identity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn "uncloaks" himself. The "white flame" and "kingly" face are signs of his power. By claiming his title and drawing the Sword, he asserts a cosmic authority that demands Éomer's respect.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "staged drama."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "literal physical transformation."
- **D** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "anger at the Riders."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about the "cloak as a suppressor."

### Question 9 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Éomer’s decision to lend the horses demonstrates:**

**Correct Answer: B. An intuitive recognition of Aragorn’s nobility, where the bond of "good faith" between individuals supersedes the rigid laws of a state under the influence of "evil counsel."**

**Why this is correct:**
Éomer breaks the law to help Aragorn. He trusts his "heart." This reflects the "heroic" bond where personal honor is more binding than legal statutes, especially in "days of doubt."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Over-Interpretation" calling it "treasonous insanity."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "horses as judges."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "deserting his post."
- **E** is a "Half-Truth" about "fear of Rangers."

### Question 10 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The appearance of the "old bent man" serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Introduce a moment of profound ambiguity and dread, manifesting the "peril" of Fangorn and the suspected reach of Saruman’s "many guises."**

**Why this is correct:**
The old man matches the description of Saruman. The loss of the horses increases the Company's vulnerability. Narratively, this heightens the tension and introduces the "queerness" of Fangorn.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about a "helpful confirmation."
- **C** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" about "source of light."
- **D** is a "Half-Truth" about "horror genre."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "blurred distinctions."
