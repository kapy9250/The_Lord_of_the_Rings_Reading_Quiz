### Question 1 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the Brown Lands as a "formless slopes... as if fire had passed over them" primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Illustrate the total, life-extinguishing impact of the Enemy’s historical presence, where the land itself has been spiritually and physically "blasted" into a state of permanent desolation.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text describes the land as an "unfriendly waste" without even a "broken tree or a bold stone." This total emptiness represents the absolute negation of life that Sauron brings. Unlike the "wild" or "unfriendly" but living Old Forest, the Brown Lands are "withered" and "formless," a physical manifestation of the Enemy's scorched-earth history that even Aragorn cannot fully explain.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While Elves wouldn't live there, the focus of the passage is on the *nature of the destruction* and its "formless" and "unfriendly" quality, rather than specifically on Elven demographics.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s changing attitude toward trees—initially wishing them gone and then "wishing that the trees were still there"—reflects:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological shift from a fear of "lurking" internal dangers to a greater fear of the "naked" vulnerability exposed by open, defenseless terrain in a war zone.**

**Why this is correct:**
In the Old Forest, Sam feared what was *inside* the woods. On the Great River, he realizes that the open plains offer no "shelter" from external eyes. His desire for trees is a realization that concealment is now more valuable than absolute openness. This reflects his growing understanding of the "frontier of war" where "nakedness" is a mortal danger.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Sam's shift is not indecision; it's a strategic reassessment based on his new environment. He is reacting to the *specific* threat of being "afloat in little open boats" in a wasteland.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Pippin’s observation of the "queer gleam" in Boromir’s eye as he gazes at Frodo suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. The escalating psychological pressure of the Ring on Boromir’s mind, which is manifesting as a fixated, perhaps even predatory, focus on the Ring-bearer.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text links Boromir's "muttering" and "biting his nails" with his "restlessness or doubt." The "queer gleam" caught by Pippin is a classic narrative marker of the Ring's corrupting influence. Boromir is no longer just a companion; he is becoming an internal threat to Frodo, driven by a growing obsession that he can barely conceal.

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The words "ill at ease," "muttering," and "queer gleam" suggest a negative, unsettling transformation rather than a positive feeling like admiration.

### Question 4 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s initial dismissal of his vision of the "log with eyes" as "dreaming again" indicates:**

**Correct Answer: B. A defensive, Shire-born psychological habit of using "common sense" to rationalize away the uncanny or terrifying realities of the wider world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s "dreaming again, Sam Gamgee" is his way of trying to maintain his old world-order. Throughout the journey, the hobbits struggle to accept the "mythic" reality of things like Black Riders and Balrogs. Sam’s reflex to blame his own "drowse" rather than accept the presence of a "log with eyes" shows the persistence of the "Shire-mindset" as a psychological defense against terror.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
There is no indication Gollum is using magic; he is simply using his natural "waterman" skills and the "half-light." The obstacle to seeing him is Sam’s own internal rationalization.

### Question 5 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s admission that he is "out of my reckoning" regarding the speed of the River reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The unpredictable, "wild" nature of the Great River, which defies even the expert calculations of a Ranger and forces the Company into a sudden, high-stakes crisis.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn is the most experienced traveller in the group, yet even he is surprised by the River's speed. This highlights that the "Great River" is a powerful, elemental force that cannot be fully mastered or predicted. It increases the tension by showing that the Company is at the mercy of their environment, leading to the near-disastrous encounter with the Orcs at Sarn Gebir.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Aragorn has been a successful guide up to this point. His "reckoning" being off is a testament to the *River's* power and the "evil days" that have changed the land, rather than his own general incompetence.

### Question 6 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "terrible cry" of the Black Rider, which Legolas answers with his bow, functions narratively to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Escalate the supernatural threat by revealing the Riders' new, airborne mobility and marking the first direct combat success of an Elven weapon against a servant of the Enemy.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud" is the first appearance of a Fell Beast. This escalates the danger from ground-based pursuit to airborne surveillance. Legolas’s shot, praised as "mighty," provides a crucial moment of hope—it proves that the "shadow" can be hit and brought down, even in the dark, using the "bow of Lorien."

**Why D is incorrect** `[CC]`:
The creature is explicitly an "enemy" whose fall causes "cursing and wailing" among the Orcs. It is a servant of Sauron, the opposite of the helpful Eagles.

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s stern warning to Frodo ("That should not have been said outside Lorien") regarding the Elven-ring Nenya emphasizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The extreme secrecy and "holy" status of the Three Rings, whose existence must remain hidden to prevent Sauron from focusing his direct, destructive attention on the remaining Elven sanctuaries.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn recognizes that Frodo’s mention of Galadriel "wielding the Elven-ring" is a dangerous breach of lore-secrecy. The Three Rings are the ultimate targets of Sauron's desire (after the One). Mentioning them openly, especially on the "frontier of war," risks drawing the Enemy’s focus toward Lothlórien. Aragorn’s reaction shows his awareness of the high-level spiritual stakes of the war.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Frodo *already knows* the truth (Galadriel told him). The issue is not his readiness to know, but the *danger of speaking* that knowledge in the vulnerable world outside the Golden Wood.

### Question 8 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Boromir’s argument to abandon the boats and strike westward into Rohan suggests that his primary motivation is:**

**Correct Answer: B. An intense, perhaps overriding, pull toward his national duty and the familiar military environment of Gondor, which is beginning to fragment his commitment to the broader goals of the Company.**

**Why this is correct:**
Boromir's focus is consistently on Gondor ("my own land," "Minas Tirith"). He views the River and the Emyn Muil through the lens of Gondor’s survival. His desire to leave the boats is a manifestation of his internal drift away from the Quest (to destroy the Ring) and toward the War (to save his city). He is essentially choosing his "home" over his "friends."

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While he calls them "cockle-boats," his reasoning is strategic and political rather than a simple personal fear of water. He wants to reach the Entwash and his own people.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The visual transformation of the great pillars of Argonath from "giants" to "two great kings of stone" mirrors:**

**Correct Answer: B. The thematic shift from the primitive, "unnatural" terror of the wilderness to the civilized, historical majesty of a fallen human empire, emphasizing the theme of ancient nobility.**

**Why this is correct:**
Initially, Frodo sees them as "Giants... silent but threatening," a typical reaction to the unknown wild. As he draws closer, he sees they are "indeed shaped and fashioned," wearing crowns and helms. This mirrors the book's overall progression from the "wild" world of Book 1 to the "high" historical and epic world of Book 2, where the hobbits are confronted with the massive legacy of the Men of the West.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Frodo "cowered down, shutting his eyes," feeling "awe and fear." He has no desire to be like these stone kings; he is overwhelmed by their scale and power.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s self-identification at the Argonath ("Under their shadow Elessar... has naught to dread!") signifies his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Full internal acceptance of his royal heritage and his role as the legitimate heir to the throne, drawing spiritual strength from the physical presence of his ancestors.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn’s transformation—standing "proud and erect" with a "light in his eyes"—is a key moment of character resolution. By naming himself "Elessar... heir of Elendil," he is publicly (to his friends) and internally claiming his lineage. The "shadow" of the kings, which terrifies Frodo and humbles Boromir, acts as a source of "dread-less" inspiration for Aragorn, confirming his identity as the "King returning from exile."

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
His tone is one of reverence ("my sires of old") and solemn duty rather than arrogance. He is finding his place in a lineage he respects, not claiming superiority over it.
