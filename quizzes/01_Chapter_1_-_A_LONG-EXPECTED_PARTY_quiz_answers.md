### Question 1 `[CIM]` `[Advanced]`

**What does the narrator's description of Bilbo's "prolonged vigour" and the hobbits' reaction to it primarily suggest about the social fabric of Hobbiton?**

**Correct Answer: B. The community values a predictable, natural order and views deviations from it with moral suspicion.**

**Why this is correct:**
The passage explicitly links the "unnatural" aspect of Bilbo's youth to a moral judgment ("It isn't natural, and trouble will come of it"). In the Shire, conformity to the biological and social norm is the highest virtue; any outlier is treated not just as odd, but as a potential source of "trouble."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is incorrect because the hobbits view his longevity as "unfair" rather than a "moral reward."
- **C** is a plausible "economic" misreading, but the text focuses on the *nature* of the life, not the *value* of the wealth.
- **D** is a sophisticated psychological reading, but "envy" is overshadowed in the text by a sense of "propriety" and "natural law."

### Question 2 `[PIS/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**During the conversation between the Gaffer and his audience at *The Ivy Bush*, what does the Gaffer's defense of Bilbo's "well-spoken" nature most likely imply about his own social standing and values?**

**Correct Answer: B. The Gaffer values professional recognition and the maintenance of traditional class respect.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Gaffer's loyalty stems from Bilbo acknowledging his professional expertise ("consulting him constantly") and using proper formal titles ("Master Hamfast"). This reflects a worldview where social harmony is maintained through mutual respect within a fixed class hierarchy.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is incorrect as it implies a cynical "performance" for employment, whereas the narrator states the Gaffer speaks with "perfect truth."
- **C** is a "sentimental" misreading; the Gaffer knows exactly where he stands (Master vs. Gentlehobbit), and it is the *preservation* of this distance through politeness that he values.
- **D** is an aggressive misreading not supported by the Gaffer's generally jovial and defensive tone.

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Gaffer’s dismissal of the rumors regarding the "pushing and pulling" in the drowning of Drogo and Primula primarily serves to reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. A desire to suppress scandalous talk that might threaten the respectability of his employers.**

**Why this is correct:**
By reducing the tragedy to the "tricky" nature of boats, the Gaffer effectively shuts down a "dark" version of the story (murder or domestic strife). This protects the reputation of the Baggins/Brandybuck lineage, showing his deep-seated tribal loyalty.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "surface-level" misreading. While the Gaffer sounds practical, his *motivation* in this specific dialogue is to silence the Miller (Sandyman) and defend his betters.
- **C** is a "lore-based" distractor; while the Gaffer does find Bucklanders "queer," his focus here is on the specific rumor of "pushing and pulling."
- **E** misinterprets the Gaffer's dislike of Sandyman as the *cause* of the dismissal, rather than the *context* of the defense.

### Question 4 `[ANT/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**What is the primary subtext of Gandalf's remark, "Who will laugh, I wonder?" in response to Bilbo’s mention of his "little joke"?**

**Correct Answer: B. Gandalf anticipates that the consequences of the "joke" will be more somber than Bilbo intends.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf's "shaking his head" and his somber question provide a sharp contrast to Bilbo's levity. Gandalf understands the Ring's power and the gravity of a permanent departure, suggesting that the "joke" is actually a serious and potentially dangerous moment of transition.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** focuses on the hobbits' intelligence, which is a common theme but not the *subtext* of Gandalf’s specific warning here.
- **C** is a "character-type" distractor; while Gandalf can be stern about magic, his concern here is specifically about the "laughter" (or lack thereof) resulting from this specific act.
- **E** is a "plot-prediction" distractor that misses the immediate thematic weight of Gandalf's foreboding tone.

### Question 5 `[ACN]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Gandalf’s fireworks, specifically the "forest of silver spears" and the "red-golden dragon," functions narratively to:**

**Correct Answer: C. Foreshadow the intrusion of dangerous, epic-scale realities into the parochial world of the Shire.**

**Why this is correct:**
The imagery of "embattled armies" and a "terribly life-like" dragon brings the language of war and ancient myth into the cozy, domestic setting of a birthday party. It serves as a narrative bridge between the Shire's peace and the epic dangers to come.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **B** is an "economic" misreading that ignores the specific *martial* imagery used in the description.
- **D** is a "plot-based" distractor that describes Gandalf’s reputation but fails to analyze the *symbolic* function of the specific firework designs.
- **E** is a "moralistic" misreading; the scene is about the *spectacle* and its foreshadowing, not a test of the hobbits' courage.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Bilbo's repetition of "My dear People" and the hobbits' subsequent "Hear! Hear!" during the speech most strongly suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A performative social ritual where the appearance of listening is more important than the content.**

**Why this is correct:**
The narrator notes that the hobbits are "reluctant to follow their own advice" (to hear) and are in a "tolerant mood" due to the food. Their cheering is a habitual social response to the *form* of a speech, rather than an engagement with its *content*.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "sentimental" misreading; the text emphasizes that their "tolerance" is a product of "filling up the corners" (eating) rather than genuine communal pride.
- **C** is an "over-calculated" reading; the hobbits aren't that organized—their reaction is more of a reflexive, pavlovian response to a party atmosphere.
- **E** is a "class-struggle" distractor that misinterprets a general festive habit as a specific sign of class deference.

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**What does the "obstinate silence" following Bilbo's mention of his arrival at Esgaroth reveal about the guests' mindset?**

**Correct Answer: B. They view Bilbo's past adventures as tedious and irrelevant to the current festivities.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text explicitly states the hobbits "feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting bored." Their silence is a collective effort to steer the evening back to the "proper" business of eating and drinking.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "moralistic" misreading; the hobbits aren't offended by his friends, they are simply *bored* by his stories.
- **C** is a "comedy" distractor; while hobbits are provincial, their primary reaction here is social dread (of poetry) rather than intellectual offense.
- **D** is an "existential" over-reading that attributes too much self-reflection to the party guests.

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Bilbo's description of feeling like "butter that has been scraped over too much bread" primarily conveys:**

**Correct Answer: B. A spiritual or existential depletion caused by an unnaturally extended life.**

**Why this is correct:**
This is the chapter's most famous metaphor. Bilbo distinguishes this feeling from mere physical tiredness, locating it in his "heart of hearts." It perfectly captures the "stretching" effect of the Ring—preserving the form of life while exhausting its essence.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "literalist" misreading; Bilbo isn't talking about his workload, but his very state of being.
- **C** is a "physicalist" misreading; the "thinness" is a spiritual/internal sensation ("stretched"), not a literal change in his appearance (yet).
- **D** is a "resentful" misreading that is not supported by Bilbo's generally affectionate, if weary, tone toward the Shire.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The "curious change" in Bilbo's voice when Gandalf asks about the ring ("sharp with suspicion and annoyance") signals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The beginning of the ring's corrosive influence on Bilbo's character and trust.**

**Why this is correct:**
The sudden shift from friendly banter to "suspicion" of his oldest friend is the "red flag" of the Ring's power. It shows the Ring's ability to create paranoia and prioritize its own "safety" over the owner's established relationships.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "conspiracy" misreading; while Gandalf *is* guiding events, Bilbo's reaction is an irrational, possessive impulse, not a logical realization.
- **C** is a "social-norms" misreading; in a normal context, asking about a personal item might be overstepping, but the "curious change" in voice indicates something far more sinister and unnatural.
- **D** connects back to the "thinness" correctly, but B is the *more specific* and primary cause of this particular emotional spike.

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**When Lobelia Sackville-Baggins tells Frodo, "You'll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn't you go too?", her primary motivation is most likely:**

**Correct Answer: B. A bitter attempt to invalidate Frodo's claim to Bag End and make him feel like an outsider.**

**Why this is correct:**
Lobelia immediately follows her question by attacking Frodo's lineage ("you're no Baggins... you're a Brandybuck!"). Her goal is to strip Frodo of his sense of belonging and legitimacy, fueled by her own thwarted desire to own Bag End.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "positive-intent" misreading; Lobelia’s "face that would have curdled new milk" makes it clear her words are purely malicious.
- **C** is a "legalistic" distractor; while the property dispute is legal, her *words* here are a personal, emotional attack on Frodo’s identity.
- **D** is a "superstitious" misreading that ignores the very concrete, material motive (the house) behind her anger.
