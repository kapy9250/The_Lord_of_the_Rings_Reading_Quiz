### Question 1 `[CIM]` `[Advanced]`

**What does the narrator's description of Bilbo's "prolonged vigour" and the hobbits' reaction to it primarily suggest about the social fabric of Hobbiton?**

**Correct Answer: B. The community values a predictable, natural order and views deviations from it with moral suspicion.**

**Why this is correct:**
The passage notes that hobbits felt Bilbo's youth was "too much of a good thing" and "unfair." The specific phrase "It isn't natural, and trouble will come of it" reveals a worldview where deviation from the biological norm is not just odd, but morally or cosmically dangerous. This reflects a conservative social fabric that prizes conformity and predictability.

**Why A is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While the hobbits are suspicious and somewhat resentful, the text suggests their reaction is based on a sense of "fairness" and "nature" rather than pure, unadulterated malice or a specific desire for his death.

**Why C is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Wealth is certainly a factor ("inexhaustible wealth"), but the question asks about the "prolonged vigour" specifically. The "unnatural" aspect of his youth is what triggers the moral judgment ("trouble will come of it").

### Question 2 `[PIS/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**During the conversation between the Gaffer and his audience at *The Ivy Bush*, what does the Gaffer's defense of Bilbo's "well-spoken" nature most likely imply about his own social standing and values?**

**Correct Answer: B. The Gaffer values professional recognition and the maintenance of traditional class respect.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text explains that Bilbo is "polite to him, calling him 'Master Hamfast', and consulting him constantly." The Gaffer's loyalty is tied to Bilbo's acknowledgment of the Gaffer's expertise ("recognized as the leading authority"). This implies the Gaffer respects a social order where the "gentlehobbit" treats the working hobbit with a specific kind of formal, professional respect.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Calling it "surface-level flattery" misses the point that the Gaffer is an expert in his field and values the *recognition* of that expertise by a social superior. It's about professional pride, not just being "nice."

### Question 3 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The Gaffer’s dismissal of the rumors regarding the "pushing and pulling" in the drowning of Drogo and Primula primarily serves to reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. A desire to suppress scandalous talk that might threaten the respectability of his employers.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Gaffer "did not much like the miller" and shuts down the darker rumors by saying "There isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling." By attributing the tragedy to the "tricky" nature of boats, he neutralizes a potentially scandalous story about Frodo's parents, thereby protecting the dignity of the Baggins/Brandybuck families he respects and serves.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While his dislike of Sandyman is mentioned, his primary goal in the dialogue is to provide a "proper" version of the family history that avoids "pushing and pulling," showing his loyalty to the Bagginses.

### Question 4 `[ANT/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**What is the primary subtext of Gandalf's remark, "Who will laugh, I wonder?" in response to Bilbo’s mention of his "little joke"?**

**Correct Answer: B. Gandalf anticipates that the consequences of the "joke" will be more somber than Bilbo intends.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gandalf "shakes his head" when he asks this. He knows the weight of the Ring and the gravity of Bilbo's departure. While Bilbo sees the disappearance as a lighthearted prank ("my little joke"), Gandalf perceives it as a significant and potentially dangerous turning point, suggesting that the "laughter" will be absent or hollow.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
This assumes the issue is the hobbits' intelligence, whereas the subtext is about the *nature* of the joke and its underlying seriousness (the Ring and Bilbo's "thinness").

---

### Question 5 `[ACN]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of Gandalf’s fireworks, specifically the "forest of silver spears" and the "red-golden dragon," functions narratively to:**

**Correct Answer: C. Foreshadow the intrusion of dangerous, epic-scale realities into the parochial world of the Shire.**

**Why this is correct:**
The imagery—"embattled army," "silver spears," and a "terribly life-like" dragon—contrasts sharply with the domestic, peaceful setting of a birthday party. These are symbols of war and ancient danger (alluding to *The Hobbit*), signaling that the wider, more perilous world is beginning to press in on the Shire's isolation.

**Why B is incorrect** `[CC]`:
The fireworks don't symbolize "industry" (which would be more associated with Saruman later); they represent "magic" and "myth," which are outside the Shire's normal experience.

---

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Bilbo's repetition of "My dear People" and the hobbits' subsequent "Hear! Hear!" during the speech most strongly suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. A performative social ritual where the appearance of listening is more important than the content.**

**Why this is correct:**
The hobbits are described as "reluctant to follow their own advice" (to hear) and "prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop" because they are in a "tolerant mood" due to the food and drink. This indicates that the speech is a formality; they aren't engaged with Bilbo's words, but with the *event* of the speech as a precursor to more drinking.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text explicitly states they are in a "tolerant mood" because of "filling up the corners," not because of a deep emotional connection to Bilbo's specific words.

---

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**What does the "obstinate silence" following Bilbo's mention of his arrival at Esgaroth reveal about the guests' mindset?**

**Correct Answer: B. They view Bilbo's past adventures as tedious and irrelevant to the current festivities.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text explicitly states they "feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting bored." The hobbits' "obstinate silence" is a form of passive-aggressive social pressure to get Bilbo to stop talking about his "absurd adventures" and move on to the toast.

**Why C is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While they might not understand foreign places, their primary reaction here is *boredom* and *dread* of a long recitation, rather than active offense or confusion.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Bilbo's description of feeling like "butter that has been scraped over too much bread" primarily conveys:**

**Correct Answer: B. A spiritual or existential depletion caused by an unnaturally extended life.**

**Why this is correct:**
Bilbo explains that he is "beginning to feel it in [his] heart of hearts" and uses the "stretched" metaphor to describe the sensation of his spirit being spread too thin over too many years. This is the first clear indication that the Ring's preservation of his body is coming at a cost to his internal self.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Bilbo says "I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts," distinguishing this feeling from mere physical tiredness from the party.

---

### Question 9 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**The "curious change" in Bilbo's voice when Gandalf asks about the ring ("sharp with suspicion and annoyance") signals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The beginning of the ring's corrosive influence on Bilbo's character and trust.**

**Why this is correct:**
Bilbo's sudden "suspicion" of his long-time friend Gandalf is uncharacteristic and reveals how the Ring is exerting a defensive, possessive hold on him. The "hard" face and "angry light" are external symptoms of the Ring's power to isolate and corrupt the owner's perspective.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While Bilbo does mention that Gandalf hasn't bothered him about other things, the *cause* of the "suspicion and annoyance" is specifically the suggestion that he part with the Ring, which he now calls "My Precious."

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**When Lobelia Sackville-Baggins tells Frodo, "You'll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn't you go too?", her primary motivation is most likely:**

**Correct Answer: B. A bitter attempt to invalidate Frodo's claim to Bag End and make him feel like an outsider.**

**Why this is correct:**
Lobelia follows this by saying "You don't belong here; you're no Baggins—you—you're a Brandybuck!" Her remark is a final lash of resentment after being "foiled" in her 60-year quest to inherit Bag End. By suggesting Frodo should have left, she is expressing her desire for him to be gone so she could finally have the home she feels entitled to.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Lobelia's "face that would have curdled new milk" and her "wrath" make it clear that she has no genuine concern for Frodo; her words are purely malicious.
