### Question 1 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "veiling shadow" that Legolas sees approaching from Isengard, described as "twilight under endless trees... flowing downwards from the hills," primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Manifest the psychological and physical "reach" of Saruman's sorcery, characterizing his power as a corrosive, unnatural twilight that consumes the clarity of the natural world.**

**Why this is correct:**
Legolas notes that it is "not mist or cloud" but a "veiling shadow" laid upon the land. This characterizes Saruman's malice as an atmospheric force that precedes his armies. It symbolizes the wizard's attempt to "over-write" the natural world with his own "shuttered" and dark vision, creating an environment of confusion and dread for his enemies.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While the shadow does help them travel, its primary narrative function is to emphasize the "unnatural" and sorcerous quality of Saruman's power, which "defeats" even the keen eyes of an Elf.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s response to the weary messenger Ceorl ("a west wind has shaken the boughs") indicates a character transformation that is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A poetic acknowledgment of his spiritual re-awakening and his reclamation of royal agency, identifying Gandalf’s influence as a restorative natural force.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden uses the metaphor of the "old tree under winter snow" to describe his former state under Wormtongue. The "west wind" is a symbol of Gandalf (and the return of hope). This shows Théoden has regained his poetic, kingly voice and his self-awareness. He is no longer "bent" by despair but has been "shaken" back into life and leadership.

**Why D is incorrect** `[PT]`:
While he is taking action to help Erkenbrand, the quote itself is a more profound statement about his *internal* state and the source of his new-found strength, rather than a direct apology for the past.

### Question 3 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Hama’s comment that "Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste... Ever he goes and comes unlooked-for" reflects a cultural perception of Gandalf as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A "force of nature" or a mythic agent who operates on a different, more urgent timescale than mortal Men, whose arrivals and departures are synonymous with the shifting tides of fate.**

**Why this is correct:**
Hama’s tone is one of acceptance and respect. He understands that Gandalf's movements are beyond the common man's explanation. This reflects the Rohirrim's relationship with the "mythic"—they accept Gandalf as a being who "ever" behaves this way, identifying him as a historical constant in a world of "dark days."

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text notes that "Wormtongue, were he here, would not find it hard to explain," implying that only a traitor would view Gandalf's haste as proof of untrustworthiness. Hama, the "Doorward," chooses to "wait until I see Gandalf again," showing his trust.

### Question 4 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Gimli’s feeling that the country has "tough bones" and his desire for "a row of orc-necks and room to swing" reveals his:**

**Correct Answer: B. Deep, lithic affinity for stone and structure, where the physical durability of the fortress provides him with a spiritual and martial clarity that he lacked during the "tiring" river voyage and open-plain ride.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gimli is "at home" in the mountains. The "good rock" of Helm's Deep invigorates him. His heart "rises" because he is in an environment he understands and can physically master. The "tough bones" of the earth resonate with his own "hard" Dwarf-nature, allowing him to regain his confidence and stamina for the coming battle.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Gimli's feeling is the *opposite* of Legolas's. Legolas "do[es] not like this place," whereas Gimli is "comforted" by it. It highlights their different racial perspectives on nature and architecture.

### Question 5 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The image of the Orcs as a "great field of dark corn, tossed by a tempest of war" during the lightning flashes serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Dehumanize the enemy into a vast, mindless, and destructive biological mass, while simultaneously highlighting the terrifying "industrial" precision of their armor and weapons ("barbed light").**

**Why this is correct:**
The "dark corn" metaphor suggests a harvest of death. It turns the hundreds of individuals into a singular, overwhelming "tide." The "barbed light" of the ears of corn emphasizes the aggressive, sharp, and cold nature of the Isengard forces. It is a terrifying image of a "tempest" that is both natural (the storm) and sorcerous (the Uruk-hai).

**Why D is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The men of the Mark are "amazed" and "the sky was utterly dark," suggesting a feeling of awe and terror rather than a confidence that the battle will be easy.

### Question 6 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn and Éomer’s "joint" sortie through the postern-gate, crying their respective swords' names, symbolizes:**

**Correct Answer: B. The formal and heroic re-unification of the two great branches of the Men of the West (Gondor and Rohan) in a shared, desperate act of defiance against the Shadow.**

**Why this is correct:**
Their simultaneous cries of "Guthwine!" and "Anduril!" link the "Mark" and the "Dunedain" together. This is a moment of high-heroic fellowship. By charging "as one," they demonstrate that the ancient alliance mentioned at the Council is being lived out in the heat of battle, providing a model of human unity that stands against Saruman’s treachery.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The text presents their actions as a coordinated and mutually supportive charge ("Together Eomer and Aragorn sprang"), rather than a competition between them.

---

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Théoden’s doubt ("The world changes, and all that once was strong now proves unsure") indicates a conflict between:**

**Correct Answer: A. His respect for ancient legends and the "unprecedented" industrial and sorcerous power of Saruman’s modern warfare.**

**Why this is correct:**
Théoden notes that "the Hornburg has never fallen to assault," yet he feels his heart is "doubtful." He is witnessing the "devilry of Saruman"—the use of blasting fire and "reckless hate" that challenges the traditional rules of siege-craft. His doubt represents the crisis of the "heroic age" leader confronted by a new, more "total" and "technical" form of evil.

**Why E is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The "unprecedented" numbers and hate *are* the reason for his doubt, but the primary conflict is the realization that the "old certainties" (the strength of the wall) may no longer hold true in this new, changing world.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Aragorn’s parley with the Orcs at dawn, where he tells them they "do not know your peril," reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. The psychological manifestation of his royal "presence," where his certainty of the turning tide (and perhaps a prophetic intuition of Gandalf's return) creates a momentary, spiritual shock in the enemy ranks.**

**Why this is correct:**
Aragorn’s "power and royalty" are revealed in his posture and his "empty hand." He is speaking with the authority of someone who "knows" the dawn will bring their destruction. This "unmasking" of his kingly nature causes even the "wild men" to pause and look at the sky, showing that true authority has a visceral effect even on the agents of the Shadow.

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Aragorn’s warning is not based on his own military might, but on the "new day" and the "peril" that the Orcs cannot yet see. It is a statement of visionary certainty rather than tactical arrogance.

---

### Question 9 `[ACN/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**The "nameless wood" that appears in the Deeping-coomb at the end of the battle represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. The terrifying, elemental intervention of the natural world (the Huorns) in the affairs of Men and Orcs, signaling that the "industry" of Isengard has provoked a retaliation that transcends conventional military logic.**

**Why this is correct:**
The forest is "bare and silent" and "darkness was under [it]." Its presence is "wizardry indeed" (as Legolas says). This is the "flood" from the forest that Gandalf and Treebeard prepared. It shows that Saruman’s "mind of metal and wheels" has failed to account for the "wrath of Fangorn," resulting in a total, non-human defeat for his armies.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text emphasizes that "the land had changed" and describes the physical attributes of the trees ("twisted roots," "tangled bough"), characterizing the wood as a literal, physical presence rather than a mere illusion.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "madness" that fills the black horses and the "piercing cries" of the Riders as they are driven into the flood primarily signify:**

**Correct Answer: B. The total collapse of the Enemy's "unnatural" order when confronted by the combined force of returned heroic kingship, wizardry, and the unleashed power of the ancient forest.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "terror of [the White Rider's] coming" fills the enemy with "madness." The Riders are "turned from fear to fear"—fearing the King, fearing the trees, and fearing Gandalf. This represents the total psychological and physical rout of Isengard. The "shadow" under which they pass is the final, irreversible judgment of nature upon their "black smoke" existence.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
The Orcs are "screaming" and "cast aside both sword and spear" in "terror," indicating their total defeat and impending death rather than any positive emotion.
