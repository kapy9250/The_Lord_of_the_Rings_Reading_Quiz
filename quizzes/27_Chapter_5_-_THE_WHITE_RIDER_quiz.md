- **A.** A tactical oversight where Aragorn underestimates the Orcs' ability to use "joy-spells" on animals.

### Question 2 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

The "riddle" of the hobbits' escape, as analyzed by Aragorn from the Golden leaf and the waybread, serves to characterize the hobbits as:

> **Relevant Passage:**

- **A.** A condescending attitude toward Aragorn and Gimli, whom he views as "short-lived children."
