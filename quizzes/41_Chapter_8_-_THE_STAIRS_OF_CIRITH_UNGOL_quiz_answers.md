### Question 1 `[ACN/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The description of the light in Minas Morgul as a "corpse-light... that illuminated nothing" and "ailing in some slow eclipse" characterizes the city’s power as:**

**Correct Answer: B. An absolute, non-generative, and anti-luminous presence that exists only as a visual marker of spiritual decay and the negation of the "true" light of the moon.**

**Why this is correct:**
Minas Ithil was the "Tower of the Moon." Minas Morgul's light is described as its exact opposite: a "exhalation of decay" and a "light that illuminated nothing." This emphasizes that Sauron's power doesn't create its own light but merely perverts and "shadows" the natural world. It creates a visual summary of the city as a place of death, where the "moon" has been replaced by a "ghostly head leering."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The tone is one of "shrinking," "loathing," and "fear." The description is intended to evoke an atmosphere of absolute spiritual horror, rather than providing any kind of comic relief.

### Question 2 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "tottering forward" toward the bridge of Minas Morgul, with his "head lolling from side to side," suggests that he is:**

**Correct Answer: B. Experiencing a total, external takeover of his nervous system by the city’s malevolent psychic field, which draws the Ring-bearer toward its center like a moth to a "deadly" flame.**

**Why this is correct:**
The text states he hurried "as if some force were at work other than his own will." The "luminous tower fascinated him," and he had to "fight the desire." This physical manifestation of his loss of autonomy shows the extreme power of the Morgul-lord’s valley. Frodo is no longer just walking; he is being pulled by a "deadly" attraction that bypasses his conscious mind.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Sam catches him "in his arms" as he "stumbles and almost falls," and Gollum is "cowered to the ground in terror." The scene is one of mortal peril and psychological violence, rather than a playful or lighthearted moment.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to reach for the "phial of Galadriel" instead of the Ring when confronted by the Wraith-lord represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A supreme, internal act of "will" that actively chooses a source of unfallen, Elven light to counter the "outside" power of the Shadow, marking a decisive spiritual victory at the threshold of Mordor.**

**Why this is correct:**
The Ring was "resisting him" and "dragging at the chain." A "great power from outside" moved his hand toward the Ring. Frodo's "own will stirred" and forced the hand back to find the Phial. This is a crucial moral choice: he rejects the "betrayal" of the Ring's power in favor of the "light" given to him in friendship. It proves his spiritual strength is still "unbroken."

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The text presents the "power from outside" as one that *moves* the hand toward the Ring, implying the Ring (or its Master) is working against Frodo's will. The Phial is the "other thing" that banishes the Ring's command.

### Question 4 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s observation that the "Dawnless Day" is a "featureless, colourless gloom" that feels "stifling but not warm" highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The spiritual and sensory "oppression" of Sauron’s sorcerous canopy, which removes the life-giving texture and "hope" of the day while maintaining a claustrophobic, "unnatural" weight on the air.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "featureless" and "colourless" quality of the world indicates that Sauron is stripping the creation of its beauty and diversity. The "stifling" but cold air emphasizes the unnatural, industrial nature of the smoke. It creates a psychological environment of "dead brown twilight" that is intended to crush the morale of those beneath it by removing the very concept of "morning."

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The environment is described as "dreadful," "menacing," and "sullen." Sam feels he is "stuck under a hedge" in a world that is "fading slowly into a featureless... gloom," which is the opposite of comfort.

### Question 5 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The different characters of the two stairways—the "Straight Stair" (steep as a ladder) and the "Winding Stair" (crawling like a snake)—serve to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Manifest the physical and psychological "torture" of the ascent, where the landscape itself becomes a series of high-stakes, exhausting trials that strip the hobbits of their remaining strength.**

**Why this is correct:**
The "Straight Stair" is a test of sheer physical endurance and nerve ("clinging with desperate fingers"). The "Winding Stair" is a longer, more insidious journey that "snakes" across the cliff. These are not just paths; they are "ordeals" designed to make the travelers "dizzy" and "endure no more," illustrating the extreme toll the "other way" is taking on their persons.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
There is no humor in the description of their "aching knees," "chattering teeth," and the "long black fall" behind them. The tone is one of grueling, high-altitude survival.

### Question 6 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s feeling that "if once he could do that impossible thing... then somehow the errand would be accomplished" reveals:**

**Correct Answer: B. A psychological narrowing of focus, where the immediate, physical obstacle of the Ephel Duath has become a proxy for the entire Quest, allowing him to manage his despair by focusing on a single "impossible" task.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo admits the terrors of the land beyond are "too far off yet to trouble him." His "weariness" has forced him to live entirely in the immediate present. By focusing only on the "pass," he protects his mind from the overwhelming "hopelessness" of the final stage. It is a survival mechanism: the mission is now simply the next step, rather than the fate of the world.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Frodo's state is one of "weariness" and "despair," and he calls the task "impossible," showing he is far from being overconfident. He is simply "bent" on the immediate struggle.

### Question 7 `[ANT/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Sam’s realization that they are "in the same tale still" when he connects the light of the phial to Beren and the Silmarils signifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. A moment of profound, mythic self-awareness, where Sam identifies their immediate suffering as a continuation of the world’s ancient, heroic narrative, dignifying their struggle through historical continuity.**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam’s insight bridges the gap between "tales" and "life." By realizing the light they carry is the *actual* light from the Silmaril Beren took, he contextualizes their "adventure" as part of a "great tale" that "never ends." This provides him with a source of "grim" humor and a renewed sense of purpose, helping him accept their "part" in the story.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Sam prefaces his insight by saying "I never thought of that before!", and Frodo agrees with him ("I don't know"), showing it's a shared discovery. Sam's "learning" is an emotional and mythic epiphany rather than a display of superior historical knowledge.

### Question 8 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s "long clear laugh" in response to Sam’s talk of future stories is described as a sound "not heard in those places since Sauron came." This laugh represents:**

**Correct Answer: B. A radical, momentary restoration of unfallen joy that acts as a spiritual "exorcism" of the valley’s gloom, asserting the survival of the hobbitic spirit even at the threshold of hell.**

**Why this is correct:**
The laugh is described as being "from his heart." In a place of "accustomed" and "evil" feelings, Frodo’s laughter is an anomaly. It "makes me merry as if the story was already written." This highlights the "unquenchable" quality of the hobbits—their ability to find joy in companionship and "nonsense" even when "stuck in the worst places of the story."

**Why C is incorrect** `[PT]`:
The text notes the laugh "released him from hesitation" and made him "merry," suggesting it was a healthy, restorative emotional event rather than a sign of madness.

### Question 9 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**The "fleeting moment" where Gollum looks like an "old weary hobbit" and touches Frodo with a look that was "almost... a caress" suggests:**

**Correct Answer: B. The brief, final eruption of the original "Smeagol" soul, manifesting as a poignant, near-redemptive impulse of kinship and pity before it is permanently extinguished by the "green glint" of his corruption.**

**Why this is correct:**
This is one of the most tragic moments in the book. For a second, the "Precious" loses its grip and Smeagol sees the hobbits as fellow beings rather than "thieves." He feels "pain" and "shaking." It is his last chance for redemption—a moment of genuine, un-manipulative affection that is immediately lost when Sam wakes up and reacts with suspicion.

**Why A is incorrect** `[AM]`:
The text describes the look as "dim and grey, old and tired," and the touch as "almost a caress." His "pawing" is later described as a "green glint," but *in this specific moment*, the narrator emphasizes his "weary" and "pitiable" hobbit-like appearance.

### Question 10 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s reaction to being called a "sneak" by Sam—saying he "has to take what's given him" and retreating into his "old manner"—marks:**

**Correct Answer: B. The tragic "sealing" of Gollum’s fate, where a moment of potential connection is shattered by a lack of trust and a sharp word, forcing the creature back into the defensive, malicious identity of "Stinker."**

**Why this is correct:**
Sam's "rough" words break the "fleeting moment." Gollum's eyes go "green" again and he becomes "spider-like." By calling him a "sneak," Sam confirms Gollum's own self-hatred and his belief that "nice hobbits" are actually "cruel." This interaction pushes Gollum firmly back into his "tricksy" persona, ensuring the betrayal that follows.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While Sam's lack of trust is the catalyst, the text describes his later "remorse" and his "sharpness" due to being startled and tired. He isn't "evil," but his "simple" suspicion proves to be a fatal obstacle to Gollum's fragile "Smeagol" side.
