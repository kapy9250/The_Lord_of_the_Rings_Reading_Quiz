### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s decision to wake Frodo to see the "Moonset over Gondor" primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Create a shared moment of high-aesthetic and spiritual beauty that grounds their relationship in a mutual appreciation for the "White" world, providing a peaceful prelude to a difficult moral choice.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir wakes Frodo for a matter of "counsel" but prefaces it with the view of "Fair Ithil." This demonstrates Faramir’s character—he is a man who values the "fair" things even in the midst of "evil days." By sharing this vision of "old Mindolluin," he establishes a spiritual peerage with Frodo, creating a foundation of mutual trust and "high" culture before they discuss the "wretched" matter of Gollum.

**Why C is incorrect** `[OI]`:
While they do capture Gollum, the text presents the capture as a separate, subsequent event that arises *because* they were on the rock and saw him, rather than a planned distraction.

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Anborn’s observation that Gollum "dives manwise" and has a "pretty mastery of the craft" highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The uncanny and disturbing "human-like" quality of Gollum’s movement, which complicates the Rangers' desire to treat him as a mere "wild beast" or a "spying breed of Orc."**

**Why this is correct:**
Anborn calls him "it" but notes his "manwise" diving. This illustrates the "uncanny" nature of Gollum—he is a "creature" that still retains the vestigial traces of his hobbit/human origins. This ambiguity makes the choice to shoot him or spare him "a harder matter than it seems," as Faramir notes. It forces the characters to confront the moral weight of killing a being that is "like, and yet unlike" themselves.

**Why A is incorrect** `[PT]`:
Anborn has his "bow here" and is ready to "shoot," showing that his primary reaction is one of military caution and the desire to eliminate a threat, rather than professional admiration.

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s explanation for Gollum’s presence in the pool—that he is "allured here by a mastering desire, stronger than his caution"—refers to:**

**Correct Answer: B. The dual nature of the "lure": the physical hunger for fish and the more profound, spiritual "hunger" for the proximity of the Ring, which makes him reckless in the presence of his "Precious."**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo explains that Gollum is "allured" and "lured." While the literal object in the water is a fish, Faramir immediately asks if he knows of the "burden" (the Ring). Frodo’s answer "Indeed yes" confirms that the "mastering desire" is the Ring’s own pull. Gollum is trapped in Ithilien because he cannot leave the "Precious," even when it leads him to a place where "death is our law."

**Why A is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While he *is* eating a fish, the context of the conversation with Faramir and Frodo’s subsequent desperate warning ("Precious will be angry!") makes it clear that the deeper, "mastering" lure is his obsession with the Ring.

---

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s feeling that his attempt to save Gollum was "too much like trickery" and "seemed a treachery" reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. A refined ethical sensitivity that grieves over the necessary betrayal of a "creature" who has trusted him, recognizing that even a "poor treacherous" being deserves a level of honesty that the situation forbids.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo saves Gollum's life, but he does so by "luring" him into a trap. He notes that it would be "impossible ever to make him understand." Frodo’s "wretched" feeling comes from his desire to "keep faith... with both sides." It shows his high moral character—he feels the weight of his "deceit" even against a creature as "wicked" as Gollum, illustrating his struggle to remain "un-Shadowed."

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Frodo "hates the whole business" and feels "very wretched." He is performing a necessary act of deception to save a life, but he finds no pleasure or pride in it, marking him as the opposite of Saruman.

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s statement that "death is our law" for coming unbidden to Henneth Annûn characterizes the Rangers' morality as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A rigid, survival-based legalism necessitated by their extreme peril, which Faramir (as a wise leader) seeks to temper with individual judgment and the "higher" wisdom of mercy.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir acknowledges the law ("death is our law") but he does not immediately execute it. He listens to Frodo’s plea and considers the "harder matter." This shows that while the Rangers must be "fell" to survive in Ithilien, their leadership remains "High"—valuing individual context and the possibility of mercy over the mindless application of rules.

**Why D is incorrect** `[OI]`:
The chapter ends with Faramir giving Frodo "safe-conduct" and "blessing," proving that his intent is not indiscriminate execution but the focused defense of his refuge.

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s response to Faramir’s questioning ("We are lost, lost... No name, no business... only hungry") serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Vocalize the absolute ontological vacuum of his existence, where the loss of the Ring has left him without a "self" or a "purpose," existing only as a vessel for primal, biological lack.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum’s reply—"No name, no business... nothing"—is a perfect summary of his character. He has been "hollowed out" by the Ring. His identity ("Smeagol") has been lost, and he is now just a collection of "hunger" and "misery." This highlights the "wraithing" process: he is becoming "empty," a state that Faramir perceives as "locked doors and closed windows."

**Why C is incorrect** `[AM]`:
While he does mutter about them being "so just," his overall tone is one of "whining," "sobbing," and "shivering." He is expressing his genuine misery rather than a sophisticated rhetorical critique.

---

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s observation that "there are locked doors and closed windows in your mind" when looking at Gollum identifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The profound psychological trauma and the "secret" shame that Gollum has buried deep within himself, which Faramir’s "keen" Numenorean insight can perceive as a structural part of Gollum’s fractured personality.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir’s metaphor describes the state of a repressed or damaged mind. He sees that Gollum is "shivering" and "unwilling" to look at him. This "lithic" insight into the human (or hobbit) soul allows Faramir to judge that Gollum *is* speaking the truth about not knowing the name of the place, while also recognizing the "dark rooms" of his deeper wickedness.

**Why E is incorrect** `[SL]`:
Faramir's tone is one of "keen" observation and "judgement" rather than a desire for mental intrusion. He respects the "privacy" of those dark rooms while warning that "murder" is among them.

---

### Question 8 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to take Smeagol under his protection, despite Faramir’s warning that "malice eats it like a canker," is based on:**

**Correct Answer: B. A principled commitment to his own "word" and the sanctity of his promise, recognizing that his own moral integrity is the only thing he can fully control in a "hopeless" errand.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo says "I would not be proved faithless." He has promised to protect Gollum and he adheres to that promise even when it is "unwise" or dangerous. This is Frodo's primary strength: his refusal to let the "evil of the times" or the "malice" of his enemies force him into breaking his own moral code. He chooses "troth" over "safety."

**Why E is incorrect** `[AM]`:
Frodo explicitly tells Faramir "I do not think you are holden to go... but I have promised." He is fully aware of Gollum's wickedness ("No, not altogether wicked," he says, implying he knows the malice is there), but chooses to keep his word anyway.

---

### Question 9 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s history of Minas Morgul, describing it as a place where "a shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls," reinforces the idea that Sauron’s power is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A psychological and spiritual contaminant that "colonizes" space through the projection of terror and the destruction of hope, turning even the most beautiful cities into engines of "sleepless malice."**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir describes how the city became filled with "decay" and "sleepless malice." The transition of Minas Ithil (Tower of the Moon) into Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery) is a story of spiritual corruption. It shows that Sauron's primary weapon is the "fear" that makes a city seem empty when it is not, poisoning the very memory of its former beauty.

**Why D is incorrect** `[SL]`:
While they are called "living ghosts," the text emphasizes the "shapeless fear" and the "malice" as the primary qualities of the city, rather than a literal spectral population.

---

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s final blessing to Frodo ("sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old grief") reveals a hope that is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A poignant, "impossible" vision of normal human joy that serves as a spiritual anchor for both men, acknowledging the near-certainty of death while affirming the value of the "life" they are defending.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir prefaces this by saying "I do not hope to see you again." His vision of "laughing at old grief" is a high heroic hope—a belief in a future that he himself does not expect to inhabit. It provides a final, luminous image of "peace" that contrasts with the "hard doom" and "hopeless errand," identifying the *purpose* of their struggle as the return to a world where laughter is possible.

**Why E is incorrect** `[OI]`:
Faramir's wish is for Frodo to return to the "lands of the living" as a simple, free individual, rather than placing any political or royal expectations on him.
