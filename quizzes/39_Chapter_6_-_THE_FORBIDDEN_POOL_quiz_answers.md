### Question 1 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s decision to wake Frodo primarily serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Create a shared moment of spiritual and aesthetic beauty that establishes a mutual trust in the "White" world before confronting the "Wretched" problem of Gollum.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir wakes Frodo for a matter of "counsel" but prefaces it with the view of "Fair Ithil." This demonstrates his character—he values the "fair" things even in "evil days." By sharing this vision, he establishes a spiritual peerage with Frodo, creating a foundation of trust before they discuss the "wretched" matter of Gollum.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects a "Mastery" motivation.
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "physical premonitions of Black Riders."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about "Elves failing to protect the Moon."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "subtext of air quality."

### Question 2 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Anborn’s observation that Gollum "dives manwise" highlights:**

**Correct Answer: B. The disturbing, vestigial human-like quality of Gollum, which complicates the Rangers’ military desire to treat him as a mere "wild beast" or Orc-spy.**

**Why this is correct:**
Anborn calls him "it" but notes his "manwise" diving. This illustrates the "uncanny" nature of Gollum—he is a "creature" that retains the traces of his hobbit origins. This ambiguity makes the choice to shoot him "a harder matter than it seems." It forces the characters to confront the moral weight of killing a being that is "like, and yet unlike" themselves.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "professional diving-craft."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Numenorean naval history."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about "Elven training grounds."
- **E** is an "Over-Interpretation" about the "Ring’s strengthening effect."

### Question 3 `[CIM/PIS]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s explanation for Gollum’s presence in the pool refers to:**

**Correct Answer: B. The dual nature of the "lure": the physical hunger for fish and the more profound, spiritual pull of the Ring’s proximity, which overrides his survival instinct.**

**Why this is correct:**
While the literal object in the water is a fish, Faramir immediately asks if he knows of the "burden." Frodo’s answer "Indeed yes" confirms the "mastering desire" is the Ring’s own pull. Gollum is trapped in Ithilien because he cannot leave the "Precious," even when it leads him to a place where "death is our law."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" that ignores the spiritual/Ring-based context.
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about a "secret plan to lead Orcs."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about the "Forbidden Pool’s magical attraction."
- **E** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that suspects a "tactical lie by Frodo."

### Question 4 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s feeling that his attempt to save Gollum "seemed a treachery" reveal:**

**Correct Answer: B. A refined moral sensitivity that grieves over the necessary betrayal of a trust, recognizing that even a "wicked" creature deserves a level of honesty the situation forbids.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo saves Gollum's life, but he does so by "luring" him into a trap. His "wretched" feeling comes from his desire to "keep faith... with both sides." It shows his high moral character—he feels the weight of his "deceit" even against a creature as "wicked" as Gollum, marking him as the opposite of the "Master" Sauron.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" comparing him to Saruman.
- **C** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "Faramir’s judgment."
- **D** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "addicted to deceit."
- **E** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "Sméagol side sensing the trap."

### Question 5 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s statement that "death is our law" characterizes the Rangers' morality as:**

**Correct Answer: B. A rigid, survival-based legalism necessitated by extreme peril, which Faramir seeks to temper with individual judgment and the "higher" wisdom of mercy.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir acknowledges the law but he does not immediately execute it. He listens to Frodo’s plea and considers the "harder matter." This shows that while the Rangers must be "fell" to survive, their leadership remains "High"—valuing individual context and mercy over the mindless application of rules.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" about "frontier justice."
- **C** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "intentional execution of strangers."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "performing a role of harshness."
- **E** is an "Academic Over-Interpretation" using the term "ontological blurring."

### Question 6 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Gollum’s response to Faramir’s questioning serves to:**

**Correct Answer: B. Vocalize the absolute ontological vacuum of his existence, where the loss of the Ring has left him without a coherent "Self," existing only as a vessel for primal lack.**

**Why this is correct:**
Gollum’s reply—"No name, no business... nothing"—is a perfect summary of his character. He has been "hollowed out" by the Ring. His identity has been lost, and he is now just a collection of "hunger" and "misery." This highlights the "wraithing" process: he is becoming "empty," a state Faramir perceives as "locked doors."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "tactical manipulation."
- **C** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "forgetting the name Smeagol."
- **D** is a "Comedy" distractor about a "philosopher of the void."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "poisonous fish."

### Question 7 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s observation that "there are locked doors and closed windows in your mind" identifies:**

**Correct Answer: B. The structural "secretiveness" and deep-seated shame of a fragmented soul, which Faramir’s High-Numenorean insight perceives as a defensive mental state.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir’s metaphor describes the state of a damaged mind. He sees that Gollum is "shivering." This "lithic" insight allows Faramir to judge that Gollum *is* speaking the truth about not knowing the name of the place, while also recognizing the "dark rooms" of his deeper wickedness. It is an act of spiritual diagnostic.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "literal architecture."
- **C** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Mordor brainwashing."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "Wizard-magic entry."
- **E** is a "Moralistic Misreading" comparing Gollum to a "better Ranger."

### Question 8 `[CIM/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Frodo’s decision to take Smeagol under his protection is based on:**

**Correct Answer: B. A principled commitment to his own "Word" and the sanctity of his promise, recognizing that his moral integrity is the only thing he can fully control in a "hopeless" errand.**

**Why this is correct:**
Frodo says "I would not be proved faithless." He has promised to protect Gollum and he adheres to that promise even when it is "unwise." This is Frodo's primary strength: his refusal to let the "malice" of his enemies force him into breaking his own moral code. He chooses "troth" over "safety."

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that labels commitment as "naivety."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "using a human shield."
- **D** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "Shire-mercy vs Gondorian harshness."
- **E** is a "Lore-Trap" about the "Ring binding Frodo's will."

### Question 9 `[PIS/SCA]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s history of Minas Morgul reinforces the idea that Sauron’s power is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A psychological and spiritual contaminant that "colonizes" space through the projection of terror, turning former beauty into engines of "sleepless malice."**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir describes how the city became filled with "decay" and "shapeless fear." The transition of the "Tower of the Moon" into the "Tower of Sorcery" is a story of spiritual corruption. It shows that Sauron's weapon is the "fear" that makes a city seem empty when it is not, poisoning its former beauty.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about "military dominance."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "Orcish urban planning."
- **D** is an "Over-Interpretation" about "saving the city for humans."
- **E** is a "Plausible Misreading" about the "Moon as an evil influence."

### Question 10 `[CIM/ANT]` `[Advanced]`

**Faramir’s final blessing reveals a hope that is:**

**Correct Answer: B. A poignant, high-heroic vision of normal human joy that serves as a spiritual anchor, affirming the value of the "life" they are defending against the near-certainty of death.**

**Why this is correct:**
Faramir’s vision of "laughing at old grief" is a high heroic hope—a belief in a future that he himself does not expect to inhabit. It provides a final, luminous image of "peace" that identifies the *purpose* of their struggle as the return to a world where laughter is possible. It is a "Window on the West" in psychological form.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
- **A** is a "Moralistic Misreading" that labels hope as "delusional."
- **C** is a "Plausible Misreading" about "becoming a farmer."
- **D** is a "Surface-Level Literalism" about the "safety of the Quest."
- **E** is a "Lore-Trap" about "Frodo becoming a King in Gondor."
